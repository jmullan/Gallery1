Hello, 

this a very little description what you have to do to make Gallery >=1.4.3 work with phpBB2 2.0.6

- Fresh phpBB2 installlation

- unzip modules.php.gz and upload modules.php into phpBB2/

- create phpBB2/modules folder

- create link in modules folder to gallery 1.4.2 (or install gallery here)

- modify phpBB2 code (see phpBB2-manual_changes.txt or use the phpBB2.patch)

Done :)
