Hello, 

this a very little description what you have to do to make Gallery >=1.4.3 work with phpBB2 2.0.6 - 2.0.22

- Fresh phpBB2 installlation

- Upload modules.php into phpBB2/

- Create phpBB2/modules folder

-- On *nix with shellaccess:
  Go to the this modules folder and create link in modules folder to gallery
  - cd phpBB2/modules
  - ln -s /path/to/your/Galleryfolder gallery   (This works only on *nix Systems)

-- On other constellations:
   Go to the this modules folder and install gallery here

- modify phpBB2 code 
	see phpBB2-manual_changes.txt

Done :)
