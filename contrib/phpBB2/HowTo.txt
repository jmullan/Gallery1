Hello, 

this a very little description what you have to do to make Gallery >=1.4.3 work with phpBB2 2.0.6 - 2.0.9

- Fresh phpBB2 installlation

- upload modules.php into phpBB2/

- create phpBB2/modules folder

- go to the this modules folder and create link in modules folder to gallery (or install gallery here)
  - cd phpBB2/modules
  - ln -s /path/to/your/Galleryfolder gallery   (This works only on *nix Systems)
  
- modify phpBB2 code 
	see phpBB2-manual_changes.txt or 
	copy the phpBB2.patch into phpBB2 folder and do 'patch -p1 <phpBB2.patch')

Done :)
