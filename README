HOW DO I INSTALL GALLERY?

Installing and configuring Gallery is done via a set of web pages.
To enable these web pages type:

	% sh configure.sh

Then go to the URL for the 'setup' directory in your Gallery installation.
This will walk you through the process of configuring the application.
When you're done, type:

	% sh secure.sh

And it will turn off the configuration application.  Gallery won't run
if it is not in secure mode.
