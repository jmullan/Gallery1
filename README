You can view the most up-to-date docs directly on the Gallery website:

        http://gallery.sf.net/docs.php
        
In these docs, you can also add user notes to the docs, to expand on
the documentation.  If you find an error or think a section of the
docs needs clarification, you can add a note.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

You should check the Gallery website often for notices of new Gallery
versions and security updates.  We *highly* recommend subscribing to
the gallery-announce mailing list.  This is extremely low-traffic, but
will provide you with announcements of new Gallery versions.  You can
subscribe at this URL:
