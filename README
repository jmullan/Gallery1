1. WHAT IS GALLERY?

Gallery is a web based photo album viewer/creator.  For the latest
information, check out the web site:

	http://gallery.sourceforge.net/

2. HOW DO I INSTALL GALLERY IF I HAVE SHELL ACCESS?

Installing and configuring Gallery is done via a set of web pages.
To enable these web pages you need to log onto your web server, go
to the gallery directory and type:

	% sh configure.sh

Then go to the main Gallery URL and it will drop you into the
configuration wizard.  This will walk you through the process of 
configuring Gallery.  When you're done, type:

	% sh secure.sh

And it will turn off the configuration application.  Gallery won't run
if it is not in secure mode.

3. HOW DO I INSTALL GALLERY IF I HAVE ONLY FTP ACCESS?

The process is pretty much the same as if you have shell access.
The complicating factor is that you can't run the 'configure' and
'secure' shell scripts.  You'll have to simulate running the 
scripts by using FTP commands.  

In order to FTP Gallery up to your web server you'll need to unpack 
it locally and then use FTP to copy it file at a time to the web
server.  The first time you configure it, you'll need to create
two special files called "config.php" and ".htaccess" on the remote
server.  The easiest way to do this is to create an empty file
(we'll call it "empty-file") on your local machine.  Then upload
that file as both "config.php" and ".htaccess".  ONLY DO THIS THE
FIRST TIME you install Gallery or you'll overwrite your existing
config file!

YOU TYPE:
	ftp> cd gallery
	ftp> put empty-file config.php

YOU SEE:
	local: empty-file remote: config.php
	150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for 'config.php'.
	226 Transfer complete.

YOU TYPE:
	ftp> cd gallery
	ftp> put empty-file .htaccess

YOU SEE:
	local: empty-file remote: config.php
	150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for '.htaccess'.
	226 Transfer complete.

At this point, you need to make both of these files writable.  You
can do this:

	ftp> cd gallery
	ftp> chmod 777 .htaccess
	ftp> chmod 777 config.php

Now you're all set to configure gallery so go to the Gallery web
page.  When you're done and it prompts you to make the gallery secure
again, you need to change your permissions back again:

	ftp> cd gallery
	ftp> chmod 755 config.php
	ftp> chmod 755 .htaccess

That's all it takes!

4. HOW DO I CUSTOMIZE GALLERY?

Documentation on this is a bit sketchy right now, sorry.  Online
context-sensitive help is on the way.  But in the meantime, it'd
be nice to change the way that Gallery looks and feels without
having to hack PHP.

There are two main ways that you can customize Gallery.  First, you
can change the theme by modifying its style sheets.  In the "css"
directory is a file called "gallery_style.css.default".  Copy
that to (in the "css" directory still) "gallery_style.css".  Tweak
this file to your heart's content.  

The other way is to customize the gallery header and footers.  There
are headers/footers for the main Gallery, for albums and for photos.
In the "html_wrap" directory you can take any file that has ".default"
and make a copy of it with the same name but without the ".default"
at the end and modify it.  

If you come up with cool themes feel free to send them to me and I'll
include them in the gallery package (or create a theme library of some
kind).
