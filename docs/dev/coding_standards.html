    <a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

    The purpose of this document is to lay out a clear set of
    guidelines for developing code for the Gallery project.  The scope
    of this document is limited mainly to PHP code, although Gallery
    will occasionally use SQL and HTML.

    <a name="WhyhaveCodeConventions"><h3>Why have Code Conventions?</h3></a>
    
    Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons: 
    <ul>
      <li> 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to
	maintenance.
	
      <li> Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the
	original author.
	
      <li> Code conventions improve the readability of the software,
	allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and
	thoroughly.  If you ship your source code as a product, you need
	to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other
	product you create.
    </ul>

    <a name="Indentation"><h2>Indentation</h2></a>
	        
    Four spaces should be used as the unit of indentation. The exact
    construction of the indentation (spaces vs. tabs) is unspecified.
    Tabs must be set exactly every 8 spaces (not 4).

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="LineLength"><h3>Line Length</h3></a>
	        
    Avoid lines greater than 80 characters.

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="WrappingLines"><h3>Wrapping Lines</h3></a>
    <ul>
      <li> Break after a comma. 
      <li> Break before an operator. 
      <li> Prefer higher-level breaks to lower-level breaks. 
      <li> Align the new line with the beginning of the expression
	at the same level on the previous line.
      <li> If the above rules lead to confusing code or to code
	that's squished up against the right margin, just indent 8
	spaces instead (<b>not</b> 4 spaces).
    </ul>

    Here are some examples of breaking method calls: 

    <pre>
      someMethod(longExpression1, longExpression2, longExpression3, 
          longExpression4, longExpression5);
 
      var = someMethod1(longExpression1,
          someMethod2(longExpression2,
              longExpression3)); 
    </pre>

    Following are two examples of breaking an arithmetic
    expression. The first is preferred, since the break occurs outside
    the parenthesized expression, which is at a higher level.

    <pre>
      longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4 - longName5)
              + 4 * longname6; // <b>PREFER</b>

      longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4
              - longName5) + 4 * longname6; // <b>AVOID</b>
    </pre>

    Following are two examples of indenting function declarations. The
    first is the conventional case. The second would shift the second
    and third lines to the far right if it used conventional
    indentation, so instead it indents only 4 spaces.

    <pre>
      // <b>CONVENTIONAL INDENTATION</b>
      function someFunction($anArg, $anotherArg, $yetAnotherArg,
              $andStillAnother) {
          ...
      }

      // <b>INDENT 8 SPACES TO AVOID VERY DEEP INDENTS</b>
      function superExtraHorkingLongMethodName($anArg, $anArg, $anArg,
              $anotherArg, $yetAnotherArg, $yetMoreArg, $anArg, $anArg
              $andStillAnother) {
          ...
      }
    </pre>

    Line wrapping for if statements should generally use the 8-space
    rule, since conventional (4 space) indentation makes seeing the
    body difficult. For example:

    <pre>
      // <b>DON'T USE THIS INDENTATION</b>
      if ((condition1 && condition2)
          || (condition3 && condition4)
          ||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // <b>BAD WRAPS</b>
          doSomethingAboutIt();            // <b>MAKE THIS LINE EASY TO MISS</b>
      } 

      // <b>USE THIS INDENTATION INSTEAD</b>
      if ((condition1 && condition2)
              || (condition3 && condition4)
              ||!(condition5 && condition6)) {
          doSomethingAboutIt();
      } 

      // <b>OR USE THIS</b>
      if ((condition1 && condition2) || (condition3 && condition4)
              ||!(condition5 && condition6)) {
          doSomethingAboutIt();
      } 
    </pre>

    Expressions using the ternary operator should be parenthesized.
    Here are three acceptable ways to format ternary expressions

    <pre>
      $alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? $beta : $gamma;  

      $alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? $beta
                                        : $gamma;  

      $alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression)
               ? $beta 
               : $gamma;  
    </pre>

    <a name="LineTermination"><h3>Line Termination</h3></a>
	    
    Ensure that your editor is saving files in the Unix format. This
    means lines are terminated with a newline, not with a CR/LF combo
    as they are on Win32, or whatever the Mac uses. Any decent Win32
    editor should be able to do this, but it might not always be the
    default. Know your editor.

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="NamingConvention"><h2>Naming Convention</h2></a>
	    
    Naming conventions make programs more understandable by making
    them easier to read. They can also give information about the
    function of the identifier-for example, whether it's a constant,
    package, or class-which can be helpful in understanding the code.

    <br><br>

    In the block below, we'll refer to a capitalization strategy
    called <b>StudlyCaps</b>.  In this strategy, multiple words are
    combined into one where the beginning of each internal word is
    capitalized.  Acronyms are capitalized like regular words.  For
    example a variable expressing the "maximum cpu speed" would be called
    $maximumCpuSpeed.

	    File names are in StudlyCaps with the first letter capitalized.
	    Try to keep your file names simple and descriptive.

	    <br><br>

	    Files that can be viewed directly by the browser should
	    terminate in .php or .html.  Files that are only intended
	    to be included or required, should end in .inc.  This is a
	    security precaution to prevent code from being run out of
	    context.  Files that contain a PHP class definition should
	    end in .class, and should also contain a class of the same
	    name as the file.

	    both are allowed.

	    <br><br>

	    Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a
	    variable name should be mnemonic- that is, designed to indicate to
	    the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable
	    names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables
	    such as loop indices. Common names for temporary variables are i,
	    j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.

	    Functions are in StudlyCaps and should be verbs.
	    Functions that return boolean values should be in the form
	    of a question as in "isEnabled".  The noun-verb formation
	    makes code easier to read, eg "Is the user enabled?" becomes
	    "if ($user->isEnabled)".

    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="ClassandFunctionDeclarations"><h2>Class and Function Declarations</h2></a>
	    
    When coding classes and functions, the following formatting rules should be followed: 
    <ul>
      <li> No space between a method name and the parenthesis "("
      starting its parameter list

      <li> Open brace "{" appears at the end of the same line as the
      declaration statement

      <li> Closing brace "}" starts a line by itself indented to match
      its corresponding opening statement, except when it is a null
      statement the "}" should appear immediately after the "{"
    </ul>

    The above rules are sometimes referred to as the 
    <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/indent-style.html">K&R</a> 
    style.

    Example:

    <pre>
      class Foo {
          function getBar($a, $b) {
          }
      }
    </pre>

    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="Statements"><h2>Statements</h2></a>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="SimpleStatements"><h3>Simple Statements</h3></a>
	        
    Each line should contain at most one statement. Example: 

    <pre>
      $argv++;                // <b>Correct</b>
      $argc--;                // <b>Correct</b>
      $argv++; $argc--;       // <b>AVOID!</b>
    </pre>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="CompoundStatements"><h3>Compound Statements</h3></a>
	    
    Compound statements are statements that contain lists of
    statements enclosed in braces "{ statements }". 

    <br><br>

    The enclosed statements should be indented one more level than the
    compound statement.  The opening brace should be at the end of the
    line that begins the compound statement; the closing brace should
    begin a line and be indented to the beginning of the compound
    statement.  Braces are used around all statements, even single
    statements, when they are part of a control structure, such as a
    if-else or for statement. This makes it easier to add statements
    without accidentally introducing bugs due to forgetting to add
    braces.  

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="returnStatements"><h3>return Statements</h3></a>
	    
    A return statement with a value should not use parentheses unless
    they make the return value more obvious in some way.  Example:
    
    <pre>
      return;

      return myDisk.size();

      return (size ? size : defaultSize);
    </pre>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="ififelseifelseifelseStatements"><h3>if, if-else, if else-if else Statements</h3></a>
	    
    The if-else class of statements should have the following form: 

    <pre>
      if (condition) {
          statements;
      }

      if (condition) {
          statements;
      } else {
          statements;
      }
      
      if (condition) {
          statements;
      } else if (condition) {
          statements;
      } else {
          statements;
      }
    </pre>
 
    Note: if statements always use braces {}. Avoid the following error-prone form:

    <pre>
      if (condition) // <b>AVOID! THIS OMITS THE BRACES {}!</b>
          statement;
    </pre>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="forStatements"><h3>for Statements</h3></a>
	    
    A for statement should have the following form: 

    <pre>
      for (initialization; condition; update) {
          statements;
      }
    </pre>

    An empty for statement (one in which all the work is done in the
    initialization, condition, and update clauses) should have the
    following form:

    <pre>
      for (initialization; condition; update);
    </pre>

    When using the comma operator in the initialization or update
    clause of a for statement, avoid the complexity of using more than
    three variables. If needed, use separate statements before the for
    loop (for the initialization clause) or at the end of the loop
    (for the update clause).

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="whileStatements"><h3>while Statements</h3></a>
    A while statement should have the following form: 

    <pre>
      while (condition) {
          statements;
      }
    </pre>

    An empty while statement should have the following form: 

    <pre>
      while (condition);
    </pre>


    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="dowhileStatements"><h3>do-while Statements</h3></a>
    A do-while statement should have the following form: 

    <pre>
      do {
          statements;
      } while (condition);
    </pre>

    
    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="switchStatements"><h3>switch Statements</h3></a>
    A switch statement should have the following form: 

    <pre>
      switch (condition) {
      case ABC:
          statements;
          /* falls through */
      
      case DEF:
          statements;
          break;
      
      case XYZ:
          statements;
          break;
      
      default:
          statements;
          break;
      }
    </pre>

    Every time a case falls through (doesn't include a break
    statement), add a comment where the break statement would normally
    be. This is shown in the preceding code example with the 
    <code>/* falls through */</code> comment.

    Every switch statement should include a default case. The break in
    the default case is redundant, but it prevents a fall-through
    error if later another case is added.

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="WhiteSpace"><h2>White Space</h2></a>
	    
    Blank lines improve readability by setting off sections of code
    that are logically related.

    Two blank lines should always be used in the following circumstances:
    <ul>
      <li> Between sections of a source file 
      <li> Between class and interface definitions 
    </ul>

    One blank line should always be used in the following circumstances: 
    <ul>
      <li> Between methods 
      <li> Between the local variables in a method and its first statement 
      <li> Between logical sections inside a method to improve readability 
    </ul>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="BlankSpaces"><h3>Blank Spaces</h3></a>
    Blank spaces should be used in the following circumstances: 

    A keyword followed by a parenthesis should be separated by a space. Example: 
    <pre>
      while (true) {
          ...
      }
    </pre>

    Note that a blank space should not be used between a method name
    and its opening parenthesis. This helps to distinguish keywords
    from method calls.

    A blank space should appear after commas in argument lists.  All
    binary operators except . should be separated from their operands
    by spaces. Blank spaces should never separate unary operators such
    as unary minus, increment ("++"), and decrement ("--") from their
    operands. Example:

    <pre>
      $a += $c + $d;
      $a = ($a + $b) / ($c * $d);
      while ($n < $s) {
          $n++;
      }
      print("size is " . $foo . "\n");
    </pre>

    The expressions in a for statement should be separated by blank
    spaces.  Example:

    <pre>
      for (expr1; expr2; expr3)

    Casts should be followed by a blank space. Examples:

    <a name="Comments"><h2>Comments</h2></a>

    If you change code and/or write new code you should add
    appropriate comments. This applies to whole files (so called
    modules when we talk about procedural code, or classes when
    talking OO), function/method definitions, included files and
    important variables.

    <br><br>

    C style comments (/* */) and standard C++ comments (//) are both
    fine.  Use of Perl/shell style comments (#) is discouraged.
    Multiple line C style comments should see the *'s aligned in a
    column (including the first line).

    <br><br>

    In addition, commenting any tricky, obscure, or otherwise
    not-immediately-obvious code is clearly something we should be
    doing. Especially important to document are any assumptions your
    code makes, or preconditions for its proper operation. Any one of
    the developers should be able to look at any part of the
    application and figure out what's going on in a reasonable amount
    of time.

    <br>

    <a name="ClassComments"><h3>Class Comments</h3></a>

    These should appear before every class, and help to explain the
    purpose of the class.  All core Gallery classes should belong to
    the package GalleryCore.  All feature or implementation based
    add-on classes modules should belong to a package named XxxFeature
    or XxxImplementation.  A class comment looks like this:

    <p>

    <pre>
      /**
       * Short explanation (1 line!)
       *
       * Some more text which explains in more detail
       * what the file does and who might be interested
       * in understanding that.
       *
       * @version &#36;Id&#36;
       * @package GalleryCore
       * @author Bharat Mediratta <bharat@menalto.com>
       */
    </pre>

    <ul>
      <li> The first line should be short but meaningful. 

      <li> The longer explanation may span several lines. Currently
	HTML markup is not retained, so try to avoid it.

      <li> One @author statement may be present. More than one author
      may appear in the statement, consisting of his/her name and
      optionally the email address in &lt; and &gt; signs, individual
      authors separated by colons. If given, the email address will be
      converted into a hyperlink automagically.

      <li> The @version statement should be used unchanged.  CVS will
      magically transform this into the actual version info of the
      file.

      <li> The @package statement should be set according to the rules
      listed above.
    </ul>

    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="ModuleComments"><h3>Module Comments</h3></a>

    A "module" is a PHP file that contains in-line PHP code.  This
    doesn't apply to code that is in a PHP class (see above for that).
    The comments for PHP files give the file a name (module) and put
    the file in a certain group (a module group).  A module comment
    looks like this:

    <p>

    <pre>
      /**
       * Short explanation (1 line!)
       *
       * Some more text which explains in more detail
       * what the file does and who might be interested
       * in understanding that.
       *
       * @version &#36;Id&#36;
       * @module EditThumbnail
       * @modulegroup Edit
       * @package GalleryApplication
       * @author Bharat Mediratta <bharat@menalto.com>
       */
    </pre>

    <ul>
      <li> The first line should be short but meaningful. 

      <li> The longer explanation may span several lines. Currently
	HTML markup is not retained, so try to avoid it.

      <li> The @version statement should be used unchanged.  CVS will
      magically transform this into the actual version info of the
      file.

      <li>The @module statement gives the file a more meaningful
      name. Usually it should be the filename in <b>StudlyCaps</b>
      form without the suffix .php.  Dots are not allowed in the name.

      <li> The @modulegroup should be one of the following. If you
      think a new group is needed, please email me (better yet the
      developers mailing list). We will add it if appropriate.
	<ul>
	  <li> Layout      - files used by the layout engine
	  <li> Application - procedural files that form the application
	  <li> Config      - configuration wizard files
	  <li> Feature     - feature specific files
	</ul>

      <li> The @package statement should be set according to the rules
      listed above.

      <li> One @author statement may be present. More than one author
      may appear in the statement, consisting of his/her name and
      optionally the email address in &lt; and &gt; signs, individual
      authors separated by colons. If given, the email address will be
      converted into a hyperlink automagically.
    </ul>

    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="FunctionComments"><h3>Function/Method Comments</h3></a>

    These explain in detail what a function does, what parameters it
    expects and what is returned by the function. Function comments
    apply to classes as well, here they magically turn into method
    comments. Such a comment appears directly above a function
    definition looks like this:

    <pre>
      /**
       * Short explanation (1 line!)
       *
       * Some more text which explains in more detail what
       * the function does and who might be interested
       * in understanding that.
       *
       * @author Name &lt;email address&gt;, Name2 &lt;other email address&gt;
       * @param type description
       * @return type description
       */
    </pre>

    <ul>
      <li> The first line should be short but meaningful. 

      <li> The longer explanation may span several lines. Currently
      HTML markup is not retained, so try to avoid it.

      <li> One or more @param statements describing the arguments the
      function expects. They must be given in the order in which they
      appear in the function definition.  A return statement, if the
      function returns something.
    </ul>

    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="ClassVariableandIncludeFileComments"><h3>Class Variable and Include File Comments</h3></a>

    These are simple: They just quickly explain what a class varibale
    is used for, or what an included file does, or why we need
    it. These comments may be longer, if you have to explain more
    (e.g. the $dbp variable in the config file). They should appear
    just above the corresponding variable or include/require
    statement. They have to be one line and look like this.
    
    <pre>
      /**
       * Some explanation of the variable or file just below this comment.
       */
    </pre>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="DocumentHeader"><h3>Document Header</h3></a>
	    
    All files should contain the following text in a form where it
    will not interfere with the purpose of the file (ie, commented
    out).  In this example, it's presented in a commented out form for
    inclusion into PHP files.

    Occasionally you wind up checking in code that's not totally
    satisfactory.  Sometimes this is inevitable.  In order to locate
    these bits of code so that we find and resolve it later, use the
    following tags in a comment, above the code in question:

    <ul>
      <li><b>REVISIT</b> - this is an optimization waiting to happen,
      or something that could be improved on later.  Optionally.  If
      we're bored.  And have itchy C-x v v fingers.

      <li><b>TODO</b> - this is missing functionality (so by
      definition, it's broken) that needs to be addressed at some
      point.

      <li><b>FIXME</b> - this is stubbed/broken functionality. But I
      need to commit.  And it can limp for now.
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    Keep in mind that you may not get back to this code for a while.
    You may not even be the one to fix the thing, so the more
    information that you provide while it's still fresh in your mind,
    the better. Potential solutions or workarounds are great, and may
    prove invaluable to whomever gets around to addressing the issue.

    <p> </p>

    If the comment isn't clear it may be ignored and eventually deleted.

    <p> </p>

    At some point in the future this will enable us to dictate the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li> No point release with FIXMEs 
      <li> No major release with TODOs

    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="AssociativeArrayKeys"><h3>Associative Array Keys</h3></a>
	        
    In PHP, it's legal to use a literal string as a key to an
    associative array without quoting that string. We don't want to do
    this -- the string should always be quoted to avoid
    confusion. Note that this is only when we're using a literal, not
    when we're using a variable.

    Examples:
    <pre>
      /* wrong */
      $foo = $assoc_array[blah];
      
      /* right */
      $foo = $assoc_array['blah'];
    </pre>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="QuotingStrings"><h3>Quoting Strings</h3></a>
	    
    There are two different ways to quote strings in PHP - either with
    single quotes or with double quotes. The main difference is that
    the parser does variable interpolation in double-quoted strings,
    but not in single quoted strings. Because of this, you should
    always use single quotes unless you specifically need variable
    interpolation to be done on that string. This way, we can save the
    parser the trouble of parsing a bunch of strings where no
    interpolation needs to be done. Also, if you are using a string
    variable as part of a function call, you do not need to enclose
    that variable in quotes. Again, this will just make unnecessary
    work for the parser. Note, however, that nearly all of the escape
    sequences that exist for double-quoted strings will not work with
    single-quoted strings. Be careful, and feel free to break this
    guideline if it's making your code harder to read.

    Examples:

    <pre>
      /* wrong */
      $str = "This is a really long string with no variables for the parser to find.";
      do_stuff("$str");
    
      /* right */
      $str = 'This is a really long string with no variables for the parser to find.';
      do_stuff($str);
    </pre>

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="IncludingCode"><h3>Including Code</h3></a>
	    
    Anywhere you are unconditionally including a class file, use <a
    href="http://php.net/require_once">require_once()</a>. Anywhere
    you are conditionally including a class file (for example, factory
    methods), use <a
    href="http://php.net/include_once">include_once()</a>. Either of
    these will ensure that class files are included only once. They
    share the same file list, so you don't need to worry about mixing
    them - a file included with <a
    href="http://php.net/require_once">require_once()</a> will not be
    included again by <a
    href="http://php.net/include_once">include_once()</a>.

    <br><br>

    Note: <a href="http://php.net/include_once">include_once()</a> and
    <a href="http://php.net/require_once">require_once()</a> are
    statements, not functions. You don't need parentheses around the
    filename to be included.

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="PHPCodeTags"><h3>PHP Code Tags</h3></a>
	    
    <i>Always</i> use &lt;?php ?&gt; to delimit PHP code, not the
    &lt;? ?&gt; shorthand. This is the most portable way to include
    PHP code on differing operating systems and setups.

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="UninitializedVariables"><h3>Uninitialized Variables</h3></a>
	    
    Don't use uninitialized variables.  Gallery will use a high level
    of run-time error reporting. This will mean that the use of an
    uninitialized variable will be reported as an error. This will
    come up most often when checking which HTML form variables were
    passed. These errors can be avoided by using the built-in isset()
    function to check whether a variable has been set.

    Examples:

    <pre>
      /* Old way */
      if ($forum) ...

      /* New way */
      if (isset($forum)) ...
    </pre>

    <a name="MagicNumbers"><h3>Magic Numbers</h3></a>
	    
    Don't use them. Use named constants for any literal value other
    than obvious special cases. Basically, it's OK to check if an
    array has 0 elements by using the literal 0. It's not OK to assign
    some special meaning to a number and then use it everywhere as a
    literal. This hurts readability AND maintainability. Included in
    this guideline is that we should be using the constants TRUE and
    FALSE in place of the literals 1 and 0 -- even though they have
    the same values, it's more obvious what the actual logic is when
    you use the named constants.

    <br>
    [<a href=#Contents>contents</a>]
    <a name="Shortcutoperators"><h3>Shortcut operators</h3></a>
	    
    The only shortcut operators that cause readability problems are
    the shortcut increment ($i++) and decrement ($j--)
    operators. These operators should not be used as part of an
    expression. They can, however, be used on their own line. Using
    them in expressions is just not worth the headaches when
    debugging.

    Examples:
    <pre>
      /* wrong */
      $array[++$i] = $j;
      $array[$i++] = $k;

      /* right */
      $i++;
      $array[$i] = $j;
    
      $array[$i] = $k;
      $i++;

    <a name="OperatorPrecedence"><h3>Operator Precedence</h3></a>
	        
    Do you know the exact precedence of all the operators in PHP?
    Neither do I. Don't guess. Always make it obvious by using
    brackets to force the precedence of an equation so you know what
    it does.

    <pre>
      /* what's the result? who knows. */
      $bool = ($i < 7 && $j > 8 || $k == 4);
    
      /* now you can be certain what I'm doing here. */
      $bool = (($i < 7) && (($j < 8) || ($k == 4)))

    Since we'll all be using different editor settings, don't try to
    do anything complex like aligning columns in SQL code. Do,
    however, break statements onto their own lines. Here's a sample of
    how SQL code should look. Note where the lines break, the
    capitalization, and the use of brackets.

    Examples:
    <pre>
      SELECT field1 AS something, field2, field3
      FROM table a, table b
      WHERE (this = that) AND (this2 = that2)

Revision 1.8  2004/02/03 05:06:12  beckettmw
 * Updated copyright to 2000-2004.

Revision 1.7  2001/11/28 06:00:57  bharat
Having learned much more about PHPDoc by:
a) trying to PHPDoc my code
b) pulling some hair out
e) realizing that they never wrote an actual honest-to-god
   MANUAL for their damn tag syntax
b) pulling some more hair out
c) reading the PHPDoc code
d) weeping to see that their own code isn't PHPDoc'd very well
f) putting debug statements in their code
g) pulling more hair out (running low!)
h) experimenting, experimenting, experimenting

I now have a better idea of what to put where.  I've revised the doc
to separate Modules from Classes and to put an example in for each
one.  The (as yet to be checked in) 2.0 core classes are now doc'd
pretty nicely.

Revision 1.6  2001/11/26 22:35:34  bharat
Backed off the line-length to 80 characters max.

Revision 1.5  2001/11/19 22:43:13  bharat
Miscellaneous small text tweaks in the PHPdocs comment section.

Revision 1.4  2001/11/15 07:31:59  bharat
Switched the "special comments" section over to using
the FIXME/REVISIT/TODO system.

Revision 1.3  2001/11/13 08:42:40  bharat
Fleshed out the comments section to include much more detail on the
PHPdoc style comment blocks.  No big changes here, just a lot more
detail.

Revision 1.2  2001/11/11 08:06:17  bharat
Numerous cosmetic tweaks, no content changes.

Revision 1.1  2001/11/10 03:26:06  bharat
Draft #1 of the definitive Gallery code style document.
