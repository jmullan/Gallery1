Image Firewall in Gallery 2.0

[[ XXX - work in progress                                  ]]

======================================================================
The image firewall is a script that will deliver all image data
requested by Gallery pages. An album image src will look like this:

  <galleryurl>/image.php?name=aaa.sized.jpg
  
Like the pages view_album.php and view_item.php, this page will expect
either:
  - an active user session containing the current album, or
  - the url param: set_albumName

image.php will verify that the user in the session has permission to
read the album before delivering the image data:

  $user->canReadAlbum($album)


Changes to Albums Directory
======================================================================
Because image.php will be loading the image data itself, it will now be
possible to move the albums directory out of the document root. The
albums directory can be anywhere on the filesystem.

The albumDirURL will go away. We only need albumDir.

One cool thing here is there will no longer be an "absolute URL" 
requirement for the Gallery URL (photoAlbumUrl).


======================================================================
issues: 
- This will break the shutterfly support. One way around this is 
  to not do user validation if the request comes from shutterfly.com.

- This will break the current mirroring functionality. As bharat 
  has discussed a revamp if the mirring concept, I'm not gonna
  worry about it just yet.

ideas:
- because the firewall is where it is in the process it could do other 
  things like dynamically generating image thumbnails or sized
  versions of images, on demand. It could manage a cache of such 
  things...
- pass the size (sized/thumbnail/highlight/full) as an url 
  parameter? Is there an reason to doing this?
