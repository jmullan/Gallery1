  is done by overlaying an image on top of another image.

  Limitations:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
     <para>
       NetPBM does not support steganography like ImageMagick.  Therefore,
       only visible image watermarking is supported.

     <para>
       <emphasis>Warning:</emphasis> Gallery does not store the original image.
       When an image is watermarked, it is permanent, and can not be un-done.
       It is assumed that the user will archive any images that they want
       without a watermark.
     </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>
       Only .gif, .tif, and .png are supported watermark file types.  These
       formats support either a transparent color (gif) or an alpha channel
       (tif and png).
     </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>
       The size of the watermark, in pixels, is the same for the full size
       and resized images.  In proportion to the entire image, the full
       size image's watermark is smaller.  This <emphasis>could</emphasis>
       be a problem when printing the images.
