 <title>Users and Permissions</title>
 
 <para>
  Since some of the early release of Gallery, Gallery has supported multiple
  users.  This allows administrators to give individual and separate users
  different permissions, based on the administrator's wishes.  Admins can
  give each user his or her own album, or allow certain users to perform certain
  operations on a certain set of albums.
 </para>
 <para>
  Managing users in Gallery is extremely simple.  When you are logged in as
  an administrator, simply click "[manage users]" on the main
  Gallery screen.  Here you can add new users, edit existing users, and delete
  users.
 </para>
 <para>
  Once you have created some users, you can give the users permissions.  If you'd
  like to give a certain user a certain permission on an album, simply click on
  "[permissions]" by an album (if it's a top level album), navigate into the
  album and click "[permissions]" (sub-album or top level album), or select
  "Permissions" from the drop down box underneath an album (sub-album only).
  This will bring up a permissions dialog, which you can give certain users
  permissions for the album.
  <note>
   <simpara>
    Gallery's permissions are <emphasis>not</emphasis> inherited.  This means
    that a parent album's permissions are not taken into account when Gallery
    decides whether a user has access to an album.  This is different, for
    instance, than the Unix permission system, which is inherited.
