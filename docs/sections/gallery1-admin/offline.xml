   A new feature in Gallery 1.3.4 is offline browsing, designed to assist you
   when using tools like
   <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">wget</ulink>
   or <ulink url="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</ulink> to make an offline
   version of your gallery. This can be for cutting a CD, keeping on your home
   machine, putting on a site that doesn't have PHP installed or any other
   purpose for which you might want a static version of your gallery.
  </para>
  <para>
   Offline browsing gives you two things: it removes links that don't make
   sense in a static gallery (like "Login" and "Add Comment"), and does not
   display links to albums in the tree above the current album, unless that
   has been visited already in this session. In other words, you can just
   download an album and it's sub-albums, and not the whole tree if you want.

   To move Gallery into off line mode, simply add <literal>set_offline=true</literal>

   To stop using offline mode, then use <literal>set_offline=false</literal>

   <para>
    You need to give the URL of your gallery directory to httrack, or it won't
    download images. So add a .htaccess file to prevent directory listing to
    your albums directory (i.e. "Options -Indexes")

   <para>
    The domain you give must be the same as the one you defined during
    configuration. eg if you put the domain as 
    <filename>http://www.example.com/gallery</filename>, then 
    <filename>http://example.com/gallery</filename> will not work.
