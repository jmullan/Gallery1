  <title>What are patches?</title>
  
  <para>
   A patch is a set of instructions that tell you (or a program) what changes
   to make to add a feature to your gallery. The advantage of a patch over just
   getting the whole files, is that a patch can make the changes to files that
   have already have changes to them. If you copied files over, you'd lose the
   other changes.
  </para>
  <para>
   Patches can be of three different forms "normal", context, and unified (and
   unified-context).  Here's what each looks like.

  <title>Applying Patches</title>
  
  <para>
   Applying patches is easiest with ssh or telnet access.  Basically, just copy
   the patch to the directory you'd like to patch.  Then simply type
   <command>patch -p0 &lt; patchfile.txt</command>
  </para>
  <para>
   If you're using Windows, you need the <command>patch.exe</command> program
   from <ulink url="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</ulink>.
   Then simply using this command: <command>patch -p0 -i patchfile.txt</command>.
  </para>   
  <para>
   If only have FTP access, you'll have to apply the patchfile manually.  Add
   lines with +, delete lines with -, and change lines with !.  It's painful, but
   you will get the hang of it.
  </para>
  <warning>
   <simpara>
    Always back up your Gallery before patching it.
   </simpara>
  </warning>
  <note>
   <simpara>
    If the patch was made with a different version of Gallery than you're using,
    it probably won't work.  You may need to apply at least part of the patch
    manually.

  <title>Creating Patches</title>
  
  <warning>
   <simpara>
    Before making a patch, especially to distribute to the public, make sure
    you have throughly tested it!  If possible, build patches aganist the
    latest stable version and CVS version.
   </simpara>

   <title>Creating Patches with CVS</title>

    For more information about using CVS see: <ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/">http://www.cvshome.org</ulink>.
    For more information about how to check Gallery out via CVS, see
    <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=7130">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=7130</ulink>.

   <para>
    Once you have created the patch, simply type this command:
    <command>cvs diff -cu > patch.txt</command>.  <filename>patch.txt</filename>
    will now contain the patch.
   </para>
   <para>
    Then build a zip file containing this patch and any new files that you have
    created as part of this change. Upload them somewhere on the web, and 
    publish the link.

    It's just as easy to make patches under Windows as it is under *nix. You
    just need the correct tools installed.  See the 
    <ulink url="http://gnuwin32.sf.net">GNUWin32 Project</ulink> for the
    "diffutils-bin" package and it's requirements.  Also get "patch-bin" as well.
