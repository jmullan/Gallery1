 <title>Generating the manual</title>
 
 <para>
  To generate the manual, you must have <literal>xsltproc</literal> installed
  on your computer (this is usually in the <literal>libxslt</literal> package).
  As of right now, the generation script uses a bash shell script, so you need
  to be in a Unix-like environment to run it (Linux, Unix, OS X, CygWin,
  etc...   ).  If you have that installed, generating the manual is relatively
  easy.
  <screen>
   cd /path/to/gallery/documentation
   ./gen html
  </screen>
  The documentation will then be generated in the <literal>dist/html</literal>
  directory.  There are other options to generating the manual, some of
  which require additional software.  To view all the options for the
  generation script, type <literal>./gen help</literal>.
 </para>
 <para>
  The generation script can also quickly test the documentation to make sure
  it's valid XML and follows the DocBook DTD.  This requires either
  <literal>xmllint</literal> or <literal>Saxon</literal> to be installed on
  your computer.
  <screen>
   ./gen test-saxon [use this to test using Saxon]
   ./gen test-xmllint [use this to test using xmllint]
  </screen>
  <emphasis>
   You should always run one of these commands before committing
   anything to the documentation.  You may break the manual build if you commit
   something with an error, and it's very easy to test before committing.
