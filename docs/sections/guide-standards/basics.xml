  Welcome to the new Gallery documentation repository.  Documentation for
  Gallery has been disorganized and uncoordinated for a long time.  Though
  many good things have been created, like the User Guide and FAQ, it was
  decided to have a new documentation repository with real standards so that
  it would be easy to coordinate and easy for authors to contribute.

 <para>
  The documentation is created using DocBook, which is the de-facto standard
  for large documentation projects in the Open Source Community.  DocBook is
  XML and very easy to learn.  There is an Open Source book available online
  at <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">http://www.docbook.org</ulink> that
  explains most everything you need to know about DocBook.

  This documentation is stored on a CVS server.  Anyone can check out the
  documentation source anonymously by using CVS.  This is how to check it out
  anonymously.
  <screen>
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gallery co docs
  </screen>

  If you have gotten access from a developer (probably Bharat), you check out
  the documentation in a slightly different way.
  <screen>
   export CVS_RSH=ssh
   cvs -d:ext:[yourusername]@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gallery co docs
   <emphasis>CVS will ask you for your password here and the docs will
   be checked out.</emphasis>
  </screen>
  You can now make changes to the documentation, as described in the next
  sections.
