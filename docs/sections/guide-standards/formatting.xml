  In order for this kind of documentation to work, things have to be kept
  consistent.  Though this can be a pain, in the long run, good formatting
  standards will make people's lives much easier.  Remember that you're
  not the only one working on this documentation.

  First of all, I'll talk about indentation.  <emphasis>Do not use tabs</emphasis>.
  Tabs are horrible if you're ever trying to reformat a document like this.  If
  you accidentally use tabs for indentation, there is a perl shell script called
  <filename>tab2space</filename> in the docs module that will help you convert it
  (it's a perl script, so you may have to edit it and adjust it to your
  perl binary).  Also, when indenting use one space per tag.  An example is
  listed below.

  Beyond all the silliness, it is important to keep code consistent.

  Secondly, lines should go no longer than 100 characters, unless a link
  or other line that can't be broken prevents this.

  If you're ever in doubt about something, try looking for something similar
  in another file and use it as a guide.  If not, feel free to ask another
  author or editor.
