  <title>Running GR on platforms without an installer</title>

  <para>
   Gallery Remote was written in Java. If you have Java 1.3 or later installed on your machine,
   you may be able to run the app with the command:
   <command>java -cp GalleryRemote.jar com.gallery.GalleryRemote.GalleryRemote</command>
   assuming you are in the same directory as the <filename>GalleryRemote.jar</filename> file.

 <sect2 id="gallery-remote.using.preferences">
  <title>Preferences</title>

  <para>
   Even though there is now a Preferences dialog, the preference files can still be edited. You should not 
   modify the <filename>defaults.properties</filename> file, but you should read it to understand
   what each preference does.  Then, you can edit the <filename>GalleryRemote.properties</filename>
   (it is created the first time GR is run) and add or replace the preferences you want to change.
  </para>
  <para>
   The preferences files used to be stored in the same directory as the GalleryRemote executable, 
   and has been moved (and renamed) to the current user's home directory.
  </para>
  <para>    
   On recent versions of Windows, this is the <filename>Documents and Settings/username</filename> directory in
   the boot partition. 
   When you upgrade from versions older than 1.0b6, you will lose your current preferences unless you copy
   the previously used <filename>remote.properties</filename> to <filename>~/.GalleryRemote/GalleryRemote.properties
   </filename> (~ means your home directory).

 <sect2 id="gallery-remote.using.imagemagick">
  <title>ImageMagick setup</title>

  <para>
   GR will use ImageMagick (IM) to speed up (very greatly) the computation of resized images for 
   thumbnails, previews and image uploads. On Windows, the installer will automatically install
   and set up a subset of the IM functionality, so there is nothing special to do.On other platforms,
   you should install IM separately (<ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org</ulink>) 
   and tell GR by renaming the <filename>im.properties.preinstalled</filename> to <filename>im.properties</filename>
   and set the <literal>imConvertPath</literal> to the exact path to the Convert executable in your ImageMagick
   installation.
  </para>

   We will add more platform support as time goes on, but we may need help. 
   If you compiled ImageMagick for a platform we don't already have support for, 
   please get in touch with me at (paour at users dot sourceforge dot net) so we can include your binaries in our standard
   distributions.

 <sect2 id="gallery-remote.using.logging">
  <title>Logging</title>

  <para>
   If you encounter a problem, the logging system may be some help, and we will definitely request it
   if you ask for support.  By default, GR writes most log information to the file <filename>log.txt
   </filename> in the directory where you installed GR. If you want to see more detailed information
   there, you can add the following lines to your <filename>GalleryRemote.properties</filename> file:
   <screen>
    logLevel=3
    toSysOut=true
   </screen>

   If you also change your InstallAnywhere launcher file Gallery Remote.lax to set:
   <screen>
    lax.stdout.redirect=console
   </screen>

   You will see the log as it unfolds in the console...

 <sect2 id="gallery-remote.using.saveload">
  <title>Saving/loading</title>

  <para>
   In order to attempt to guarantee that you will not lose your hard work if the upload doesn't work
   and Gallery Remote doesn't recover gracefully, it will save the project before attempting to
   upload into the same folder your Gallery Remote options file resides. If something does happen,
   you can load the project again, and even modify it (it's XML). You can also save and open a project
   at any time.  Project files use the extension .grg (for Gallery Remote gallery); this extension is
   not automatically mapped to Gallery Remote (you can't double click the project files and expect
   something useful to happen).

 <sect2 id="gallery-remote.using.https">
  <title>Using HTTPS</title>

  <para>
   You can use https:// URLs with Gallery Remote to connect to secured web sites. This functionality
   is only available on Java 1.4 and later.  If the site you are attempting to connect to uses a
   server certificate that is not certified by a trusted certificate authority, Gallery Remote will
   be unable to connect. If that happens, you will need to add the site's certificate to the Java
   registry of trusted certificates. The process for doing this is detailed <ulink url="http://www.infy.com/knowledge_capital/thought-papers/usingHTTPwith_java.pdf">here</ulink>
