  <title>ImageMagick</title>
  <para>
   ImageMagick can be found <ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">here</ulink>.
   We use ImageMagick to resize images prior to uploading them.
   In the future, we'll implement features such as watermarking or arbitrary ImageMagick manipulation.

   <ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/Copyright.html">ImageMagick</ulink> is licensed under its own license.

  <title>JSX</title>
  <para>
   JSX can be found <ulink url="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ebren/JSX/">here</ulink>.
   We use JSX to provide save/load support. In the future, this may be used to allow external tools to 
   automatically generate projects that can then be loaded into Gallery Remote.

 <sect2 id="gallery-remote.software.jpegtran">
  <title>Jpegtran</title>
  <para>
   The Win32 version of Jpegtran, compiled and patched by <ulink url="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/">Guido Vollbeding</ulink>.
   We use Jpegtran to rotate pictures before upload. In the future, it may also be used to crop pictures.
  </para>
  <para>
   Jpegtran doesn't appear to have any particular license, but is obviously redistributable, 
   since it comes with most Linux distributions. Guido's version is freely downloadable.
