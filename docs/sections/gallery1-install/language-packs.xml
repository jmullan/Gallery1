 <title>Installing Language Packs</title>

  Since version 1.4, Gallery has supported many different languages.  In 1.4, we
  shipped Gallery with <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> languages in the release.
  However, in Gallery 1.4.1 and later, we distribute each language
  individually in a language "pack."  Gallery's native language is English;
  however, if you'd like to use Gallery in another language, you must download
  a language pack and install it.  This is advantageous because you can
  pick which language or languages you want Gallery to be displayed in.
  This also reduces the size of the general release package.

  You can download language packs for the most recent release on
  <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130">
  The Gallery SF.net Download Page</ulink>.  Pick the language you want, download
  it, and untar it.  You will get a directory that looks something like
  <emphasis>[language]_[COUNTRY]</emphasis>.  Just upload this directory
  (in BINARY FTP mode) to the <filename>locale/</filename> directory of
  your Gallery installation.  After that, simply rerun the
  <link linkend="gallery1-install.config-wizard">configuration wizard</link>
  to enable the language.
