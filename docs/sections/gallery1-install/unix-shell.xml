  Before you can start doing anything, you must first download Gallery.  Gallery
  is available for download from the
  <ulink url="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130">SourceForge Download
  Page</ulink>.  Once you have downloaded Gallery, you're ready to start
  installing it.

    You now need to untar Gallery.  Move the Gallery tarball (named
    gallery-1.x.x.tar.gz to somewhere in your web directory [accessible to
    the web]).  Next type the following command:
    <screen>
     tar -xvzf gallery-1.x.x.tar.gz
    </screen>
    You will see a long list of files.  You are now ready for the next step.

    Create two blank files, &htaccess; and
    &config.php;.  The easiest way is to use the <command>touch
    </command> command.
    <screen>
     touch config.php .htaccess
    </screen>
    Now, you need to chmod both of these files 0777.
    <screen>
     chmod 0777 config.php .htaccess
    </screen>
    You also need to chmod the <filename>setup/</filename> directory 0755.
    <screen>
     chmod 0755 setup
    </screen>

    You now need to create a directory to hold Gallery's albums.  You can
    create the directory anywhere in your web space (accessible via the web).
    It is easiest to just create another directory in your gallery/ directory.
    <screen>
     mkdir albums
    </screen>
    This directory must be chmodded 0777
    <screen>
     chmod 0777 albums
    </screen>
    If you didn't create the albums directory in your Gallery directory, make
    sure you remember where you did create it.  You'll need to tell Gallery where
    you put it later.
