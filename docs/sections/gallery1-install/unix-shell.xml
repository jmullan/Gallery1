  Before you can start doing anything, you must first download Gallery.  Gallery
  is available for download from the
  <ulink url="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130">SourceForge Download
  Page</ulink>.  Once you have downloaded Gallery, you're ready to start
  installing it.

    First, untar Gallery.  Move the Gallery tarball (named
    gallery-1.x.x.tar.gz to somewhere in your web directory).  Next type 
    the following command:
    <screen>
     tar -xvzf gallery-1.x.x.tar.gz
    </screen>
    You should see a long list of files as Gallery is decompressed.

    Create two blank files, &htaccess; and
    &config.php; and chmod them world-writable.
    <screen>
     touch config.php .htaccess
     chmod 0777 config.php .htaccess
    </screen>

    You now need to create a directory to hold Gallery's albums.  You can
    create the directory anywhere in your web space (accessible via the web).
    It is easiest to just create another directory in your gallery/ directory.
    <screen>
     mkdir albums
    </screen>
    This directory must be chmodded 0777
    <screen>
     chmod 0777 albums
    </screen>
