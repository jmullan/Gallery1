    Call one &htaccess; and the other &config.php;. Place these inside the

     <para>
      In Notepad, be sure to select "All Files (*.*)" when saving the file, so
      the file does not have a .txt suffix.  &htaccess; and &config.php; will not
      work if they have a .txt extension

    Upload the Gallery directory  (which should now include &config.php; and &htaccess;)
    to your server using an FTP program (like WS_FTP, CuteFTP or Fetch). Upload

    Gallery requires some files and directories to be set writable by the web
    server.  If you are unsure of how to chmod files, see information listed at <ulink
    url="http://www.eclecticpixels.com/tutorials/chmod/">http://www.eclecticpixels.com/tutorials/chmod/</ulink>. Chmod
    as follows:
    <programlisting>
     chmod 777 albums (this is the album dir created in step 2)
     chmod 666 .htaccess
     chmod 666 config.php
     chmod 755 setup/ (setup/ is a directory)
