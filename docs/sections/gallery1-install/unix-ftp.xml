    Upload the Gallery directory to your server using an FTP program
    (like WS_FTP, CuteFTP or Fetch). Upload all files except for image
    files in <emphasis>ASCII</emphasis> mode. Upload image files in
    <emphasis>binary</emphasis> mode. <emphasis>Keep the directory
    tree intact</emphasis>&#8212;you should see 12 folders INSIDE the

    Gallery will use this directory to store the albums you create and

    You need to set permissions to make some of the files and
    directories writable. This involves using the
    <function>CHMOD</function> command. If you do not understand
    <function>CHMOD</function>, there are some resources and
    information listed at <ulink
    url="http://www.eclecticpixels.com/tutorials/chmod/">http://www.eclecticpixels.com/tutorials/chmod/</ulink>. Chmod
    as follows:
    <programlisting>
     chmod 666 .htaccess
     chmod 666 config.php
     chmod 755 setup
    </programlisting>
