    If after you upgrade your Gallery, you get a blank screen or a PHP error
    (e.g. "function not found", etc...), don't panic.  Your FTP client probably
    didn't override all the files.  The solution is to delete all the Gallery
    files except &config.php; and your albums directory and re-upload Gallery
    (don't forget to re-run the configuration wizard).

 <sect2 id="gallery1-install.upgrade.modified">
  <title>Upgrading a modified Gallery</title>
  
  <para>
   Upgrading a Gallery installation you have modified can be difficult.  By modified,
   we mean modifying the actual PHP code Gallery runs on.  If you just made changes
   in the <filename>html_wrap/</filename> or <filename>css/</filename> directories, 
   you should have no worries (you should have removed the .default extension from
   the files before modifying them, so that they won't get overridden when upgrading) and
   can proceed upgrading Gallery using one of the guides above.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you indeed have modified some of the PHP code that Gallery uses, upgrading will
   be more difficult, but not totally impossible.  It will be, however, extremely hard
   or impossible to upgrade a modified Gallery without shell access to the server.  Keep
   this in mind.  First, you'll need to download the original non-modified Gallery version
   that corresponds to the version you are currently using (i.e. if you modified Gallery 1.3.4,
   re-download an unmodified Gallery 1.3.4).  Unpack it in the same directory that your modified
   Gallery is in, but name is something like <filename>orig_gallery/</filename>.  You should now
   have two directories, <filename>gallery/</filename> (or whatever your modified Gallery's directory
   name is) and <filename>orig_gallery/</filename>.  Next, run this command:
   <screen>
    diff -r -C 3 orig_gallery gallery &gt; changes.txt
   </screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   You now have a patch file containing the changes you made.  Next, download the newest version
   of Gallery (the one you want to upgrade to).  "cd" to the parent directory of the new unpacked
   Gallery.  Run this command:
   <screen>
    patch &lt; changes.txt
   </screen>
  </para>
  <warning>
   <para>
    The odds are that this won't completely work, because we may have made changes to the same
    line you changed, causing <command>patch</command> to get confused.  However, it's worth
    a try.
