  Gallery is a slick web based photo album written using PHP. Easy to install
  (it includes a config wizard), it provides users with the ability to create
  and maintain their own albums in the album collection via an intuitive web
  interface. Photo management includes automatic thumbnail creation, image
  resizing, rotation, ordering, captioning, searching and more. Albums can 
  have read, write and caption permissions per individual authenticated user
  for an additional level of privacy.

  Gallery was created in an effort to prevent well-meaning folks from sending
  us obscenely large photos by email. It was designed to provide an easy
  place for friends and relatives to create and maintain their own photo
  albums.
