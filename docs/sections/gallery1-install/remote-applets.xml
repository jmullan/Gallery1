  You can download the most recent version of the applets from
  <ulink url="http://www.jpmullan.com/galleryupdates/">the
  nightly builds site</ulink>. Get the latest version of the file

  You can test that the applets are installed correctly by logging in,
  going to an album where you have upload permission, and using
  the <command>add pictures</command> command in the admin menu.
  If you see <command>Applet (mini)</command> and <command>Applet (window)</command> in the available
  tabs, the applets are available.
