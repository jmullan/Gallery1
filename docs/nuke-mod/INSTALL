1) Put this directory in your Nuke's modules/ directory.  Rename is GalleryDocs
It *must* be named GalleryDocs

2) Insert the doc-notes.sql file into your database, in the same database
that Nuke uses

3) Symlink the "dist/galleryweb" directory generated by a "./gen galleryweb"
or "./gen dist" from where the docs are checked out to "galleryweb" here.
E.g.
 ln -sf /path/to/docs/dist/galleryweb /path/to/nuke/modules/GalleryDocs/galleryweb

4) Note admins should have moderate permissions

5) Setup a cron job to automatically update and generate the docs every once
in a while.  Also make sure this directory gets "cvs updated" or changes won't
take effect.

6) Enjoy!
