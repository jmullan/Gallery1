STEPS TO ROLLING OUT A NEW GALLERY 1.X PACKAGE

1. In your development gallery, edit the Version.php file and set the Gallery
   version appropriately.  It should either be something like:

	1.3.4
	
   or for a release candidate:
	
	1.3.4-RC1
	1.3.4-RC2

2. cvs rtag both the "gallery" and "java" modules.  Using rtag tags the repository
   code so there's no issue if you have something checked out in your
   dev tree.  You have to tag java as well as gallery since the image crop java applet
   is in there.  Use a tag like this:

	RELEASE_1_3_4
   or:
	RELEASE_1_3_4_RC1

3. In the current directory, cvs checkout a new version of gallery into a sub
   directory called "gallery".  Never do anything with this gallery!  It must
   always be in a pristine state.  You only need to do this once.

   Also check out a new version of the docs into the current directory in a 
   sub directory called "docs".

4. type "make package"

   This will spit out a new tarball containing only the files that should be in
   the release.  It will be marked with the current version from the Version file
   so it be formatted like so:
   
   	gallery-1.3.4-RC1.tar.gz
   	gallery-1.3.4.tar.gz
   
   It shouldn't have a -cvs tag, like this:
   
	gallery-1.3.4-cvs-b39.tar.gz

5. Type "make export" and the file will get ftp'd to sourceforge.net

6. Go to sf.net and do a file release of the new version.  Take great care the
   first time you do it (it's not totally intuitive) to follow the patterns set
   up by the existing file releases.

   After releasing an official version (not a release candidate, etc) you should
   make sure to hide releases until only the last two releases are visible.  So
   if you just published 1.3.4, make sure that only 1.3.4 and 1.3.3 are visible.
