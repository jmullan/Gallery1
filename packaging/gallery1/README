STEPS TO ROLLING OUT A NEW GALLERY 1.X PACKAGE

1. In your development gallery, edit the Version.php file and set the Gallery
   version appropriately.  It should either be something like:

	1.3.4
	
   or for a release candidate:
	
	1.3.4-RC1
	1.3.4-RC2

2. cvs tag the "gallery", "java", and "docs" modules.  You can't use
   rtag because it will apply to the HEAD and you're almost definitely
   working off of a release branch.  So make sure that your modules
   are *up to date* with "cvs update" before tagging!  You have to tag
   docs and java as well as gallery since the image crop java applet
   and relevant docs are in these packages.  Use a tag like this:

	RELEASE_1_3_4
   or:
	RELEASE_1_3_4_RC1

3. Set CVSROOT to an appropriate value, something like:
	:ext:user@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gallery
   and edit Makefile to point to the BRANCH you have just created.
	
4. type "make clean"
	"make package"

   This will spit out a new tarball in the tardir directory containing
   only the files that should be in the release.  It will be marked
   with the current version from the Version file so it be formatted
   like so:
   
   	gallery-1.3.4-RC1.tar.gz
   	gallery-1.3.4.tar.gz
   
   It shouldn't have a -cvs tag, like this:
   
	gallery-1.3.4-cvs-b39.tar.gz

5. Type "make export" and the file will get ftp'd to sourceforge.net

6. Go to sf.net and do a file release of the new version.  Take great care the
   first time you do it (it's not totally intuitive) to follow the patterns set
   up by the existing file releases.

   After releasing an official version (not a release candidate, etc) you
   should make sure to hide releases until only the last two releases are
   visible.  So if you just published 1.3.4, make sure that only 1.3.4 and
   1.3.3 are visible.

7. Make announcements here:
	http://gallery.sourceforge.net
	http://mods.postnuke.com
		(http://mods.postnuke.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=1422)

    Old posts in (parens) are ones you can copy.

8.  Rejoice!
