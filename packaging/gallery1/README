STEPS TO ROLLING OUT A NEW GALLERY 1.X PACKAGE

1. In your development gallery, edit the Version.php file and set the Gallery
   version appropriately.  It should either be something like:

	1.3.4
	
   or for a release candidate:
	
	1.3.4-RC1
	1.3.4-RC2

2. Update the ChangeLog and put in a divider of some kind (look for 
   others farther down for examples).  

3. Rebuild the file manifest, 
       php tools/build_manifest.php
  [Note can only be run from command line].       

4. Commit these three changed files.


5. cvs tag the "gallery", "java", and "docs" modules.  You can't use
   rtag because it will apply to the HEAD and you're almost definitely
   working off of a release branch.  So make sure that your modules
   are *up to date* with "cvs update" before tagging!  You have to tag
   docs and java as well as gallery since the image crop java applet
   and relevant docs are in these packages.  Use a tag like this:

	RELEASE_1_4_1
   or:
	RELEASE_1_4_1_RC4

6. Remove tags from any files that should not be in the release.  For 
   instance, nothing in the locale directory except en_US should be 
   included in a standard release.  So untag everything in locale except en_US.
   Similarly, tools should not be tagged.

ie	cd gallery
	cvs tag RELEASE_1_4_1
	cd tools
	cvs tag -d RELEASE_1_4_1
	cd ../locale
	cvs tag -d RELEASE_1_4_1
	cd en_US
	cvs tag RELEASE_1_4_1


7. Set CVSROOT to an appropriate value, something like:
	:ext:user@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gallery
   and edit Makefile to point to the BRANCH you have just created.
	
8. type "make clean"
	"make package"

   This will spit out a new tarball in the tardir directory containing
   only the files that should be in the release.  It will be marked
   with the current version from the Version file so it be formatted
   like so:
   
   	gallery-1.3.4-RC1.tar.gz
   	gallery-1.3.4.tar.gz
   
   It shouldn't have a -cvs tag, like this:
   
	gallery-1.3.4-cvs-b39.tar.gz

9. Type "make export" and the file will get ftp'd to sourceforge.net

10. Go to sf.net and do a file release of the new version.  Take great care the
   first time you do it (it's not totally intuitive) to follow the patterns set
   up by the existing file releases.

   After releasing an official version (not a release candidate, etc) you
   should make sure to hide releases until only the last two releases are
   visible.  So if you just published 1.3.4, make sure that only 1.3.4 and
   1.3.3 are visible.

11. Make announcements here:
