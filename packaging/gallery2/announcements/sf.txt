Gallery 2 Release Candidate 2 (kthxbye) Released!

This is the second release candidate of Gallery 2.  If all goes well,
the next release will be the final version.  The purpose of this
release candidate is to let the product cool for a couple of weeks so
that we can identify any fix any last minute issues that you may
discover.  You should download and use it as if it were the final release.

We have made small improvements since the RC-1 release.  As with RC-1,
we have 4 different packages for you to choose from.  You can read all
about it on our Gallery 2 Download Page.

As always before you ask for help, please, please read the README --
we've made an effort to answer all of your questions there. Especially
read the known issues section. If you're upgrading, be sure to scan
the super easy updating instructions first. Then head on over to the
G2 Forums and let us know what you think!

Thanks for your continued support!
