Hello,

This a description what you have to do to integrate Gallery 1.4.3+ into Mambo 4.5+

- Install Mambo

- Install Gallery

- Go to the Mambo component Management and "install" Gallery as a Mambo component.
  Enter the directory that has the gallery.xml file in it
  (eg. /home/mysite/public_html/gallery/contrib/mambo)

- Go into the component/gallery backend and fill in the location of the gallery component
  (eg. /home/mysite/public_html/gallery)

- Specify the minimum Mambo admin level required to gain editor access to the gallery

- Edit your main menu and add a new Component item.  Select Gallery from the list of available components.
  Mambo should do all the work of generating the link for you.

Note: Gallery will use the Language corresponding to the Country Locale specified by Mambo.
