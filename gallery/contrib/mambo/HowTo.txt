Hello,

this a very little description what you have to do to make Gallery >=1.4.3 work with Mambo 4.5

- Install Mambo >=4.5

- Install Gallery >=1.4.3

- Go to the Mambo component Managment and "install" Gallery as a Mambo component.
  Enter the directory that has the gallery.xml file in it
  (eg. /home/mysite/public_html/gallery/contrib/mambo)

- Go into the component/gallery backend and fill in the location of the gallery component
  (eg. /home/mysite/public_html/gallery)

- Specify the minimum Mambo admin level required to gain editor access to the gallery

- Then add the Gallery component as URL at the place you want.


Note: Gallery will use the Language corresponding to the Country Locale specified by Mambo.
