This readme gives you a very short view how to make your own translation

- if necessary, create a new gallery.pot file
  'sh create_po_template.sh'
  This requires xgetText version 0.12.1 or later
  this works only on *nix System with bash.
  Normally this is not needed, because the .pot that comes with the newest gallery should be actual

- copy gallery.pot (po template) to your own .po File

- Your .po Translation-File has to be named language_COUNTRY-gallery.po

  For example : english, Great Britain -> en_GB-gallery.po (or en_US-gallery.po for USA)
  		de, Deutschland -> de_DE-gallery.po

- Don't forget to change the header Information correctly (charset etc ..)
  Note : A good Tool to Edit .po files is poEdit works on Windows Systems, too.
  Available from http://poedit.sourceforge.net/

- Note :
  if you see something like : msgid "Upgrading item %d of %d . . . "
  or msgid "%s (%s), %s on %s"
  then leave the %d or %s in your translation. They are place holder for things like "time" or "times" or numbers.
  if you see something like \" leave it, too. its a quoted "
  

- If all translations a done run make_mo_files.sh
  'sh make_mo_files.sh'
  this works only on *nix System with bash
  if you dont have shell access : 
    copy your .po file into the po filder. 
    use poEdit and create a gallery.mo file from your .po file
    copy this gallery.mo intolocale/<language_COUNTRY>/LC_MESSAGES/

- Add your new language to getNLS in nls.php
