EZ Prints, PhotoAccess and Shutterfly are based in the United States. All services will give a small donation to the Gallery project for every print you make. If you choose Shutterfly's &quot;with donation&quot; option, Gallery will charge an extra 2 cents (US) for every photo printed, and 1.8 cents of that will get donated back to the Gallery project. EZ Prints, PhotoAccess and Fotokasten do not charge extra for the Gallery donation. Using these services is a great way for you to help support this free software."
