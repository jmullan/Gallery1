1.4.1: Note for UPGRADING existing Galleries
=====================================

This is for users upgrading from older versions of Gallery to 1.4.1.
As you can see, we have made Gallery much more configurable.  This
means that it if you have customized your style sheets, you will
need to make a small change to keep your Gallery looking good.

So, if you have a file called gallery/css/embedded_style.css (ie
without the .default ending) then you should update it.  Download
your version, open it in Notepad, and cut and paste the contents
of gallery/css/embedded_style.css.diff to the end.  You can configure
the new classes if you want to, and then upload the new version to
your website.
