1.4.1: Note for UPGRADING existing Galleries
============================================
[this is in addition to the upgrading instructions found at 
 http://gallery.sf.net/docs.php ]

This is for users upgrading from older versions of Gallery to 1.4.1.
As you can see, we have made Gallery much more configurable.  This
means that it if you have customized your style sheets, you will
need to make a small change to keep your Gallery looking good.

If you have a file called gallery/css/embedded_style.css (ie
without the ".default" ending) you should update it.  Download your
version, open it in Notepad, and cut and paste the contents of
gallery/css/embedded_style.css.diff to the end.  You can configure
the new classes if you want to, and then upload the new version to
your website.

You do not need to make any changes to standalone.css.

Gallery 1.4.1 also has configurable image frames.  If you have customized
frames for your images, they should still work with 1.4.1.
However, if you would like to use the new frames, you will need to
remove the following files, as appropriate:
    html_wrap/inline_albumthumb.frame   html_wrap/inline_photo.frame
    html_wrap/inline_gallerythumb.frame html_wrap/inline_photothumb.frame
    html_wrap/inline_moviethumb.frame
