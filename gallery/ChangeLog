2008-08-11 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>

 Recently, we retained Gotham Digital Science (GDS) to perform security audits on Gallery 1.6
 They found a lof security isses which we fixed in Gallery 1.6 and then merged to 1.5.8.
 As 1.6 has so many changes it was not possible to really port all changes.
 Result is a heavy codebase change in Gallery 1.5.8

 GDS found bugs in 21 catecories as they are:

 --- PRIO 1 ----
  1 - Insecure Command Execution
  2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  3 - Unauthorized Access to File System
  4 - Role-Based Authorization Not Adequately Enforced

 --- PRIO 2 ----
  5 - Application Insecurely Discloses Potentially Sensitive Data
  6 - Inadequate Password Complexity Enforcement
  7 - New Password Functionality Susceptible to Brute Force Attacks

 --- PRIO 3 ----
  8 - Inadequate Application Error Handling and Suppression
  9 - Username Enumeration
  10 - Log Forging

   --- PRIO 4 ----
  11 - Denial of Service Condition Possible
  12 - Un-mapped File Extensions Allow Source Code Disclosure
  13 - Lack of Web Root Clean-up and Insecure File Organization
  14 - Logout Option not Available on all Application Pages
  15 - Pages Do Not Refresh After Idle Session Timeout
  16 - Sensitive POST Data Exposed to Browser Caching
  17 - Password Reset Does not Include at least One Challenge Question
  18 - Application Account Lockout not Enforced
  19 - Sensitive Data Passed in Query String
  20 - Scope of HTTP Request Variables Not Enforced
  21 - User Controllable Messages


 A Local File Include Vulnerability was found by a different company.

   We say thank you to:
   The security researchers from Digital Security company
   http://dsec.ru

  If you need more detailed information on the bugs and how they were fixed, please write a mail to

 * SECURITY BUGFIX *

 + Inadequate Application Error Handling and Suppression +

 Detailed error messages often result from unhandled or unexpected exceptions
 within application code. These messages are
 often the stepping-stone to more complex attacks because they typically
 provide information that indicates why an error
 occurred which can be further leveraged to refine successful attacks.


 Other Changes:

 * CHANGE: The constant LOAD_SESSIONS needs to be set before gallery
   session.php can be loaded.


 * CHANGE: Renamed printAlbumOptionList() into albumOptionList().
           Also does not print the options list anymore.
           Its returned as array.

           Same for printNestedVals() -> nestedAlbumOptionList()

 * CHANGE: New parameter for gTranslate
           $short = false ; previous behaviour is like this is set true!!

 * Fix: After deleting an album, the opener page is reloaded correctly.

 * Fix: Full imlementation for userDB->isInitialized()

 * Change: Cleanup and modified structure of albumProperties.php

 * Change: place of navigation icons.

 * Change: Better error and exception handling in
	    - album_permissions.php
            - photo_owner.php

 * NEW:
        lib/text.php
        lib/users.php

 * Change: Use printPopupStart() for the most popups.
           Moved from lib/content.ptp into lib/popup.php

 * New functions:
   - popup_link2($title, $url, $args = array())


 * New methods:
   -- Album->isImage($id)
   -- Album->isImageByIndex($index)
   -- AlbumItemm->isImage()

2008-08-06 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.5.8-svn-b32

 *
 *** SECURITY BUGFIX ****

 + Inadequate Password Complexity Enforcement +

 The application does not enforce adequate password complexity requirements
 for user passwords.

 + New Password Functionality Susceptible to Brute Force Attacks +

 *** SECURITY BUGFIX ****

 Portions of the application were discovered that disclose
 sensitive data to application users.

 *
 **
 *** SECURITY BUGFIX ****

 + Role-Based Authorization Not Adequately Enforced +

 The application determines whether certain functionality is available in
 the user-interface (UI) based on role/group-membership
 (admin, custom groups, etc) and assigned permissions (i.e. canChangeOwnPw,
 canWriteToAlbum, etc).
 Several components were identified that do not perform adequate server-side
 checks for appropriate role-membership and/or assigned permissions.
 This makes it possible to access functionality not normally available in the
 UI and perform potentially sensitive application-level tasks.


 * New functions:
   - returnToPathArray($album = NULL, $withCurrentAlbum = true,
                       $photoview = false)

2008-08-06 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.5.8-svn-b28

 *
 **
 *** SECURITY BUGFIX ****

 + Unauthorized Access to File System +

 Several application components expose functionality that permits users to
 remotely manipulate the underlying file system of the hosting web server.
 This includes the ability to retrieve arbitrary directory listings,
 read and delete arbitrary files, and write arbitrary data to existing
 files.


 * New functions:
   - LoginLogoutButton() !!
   - printInfoBox()

 * New: Added some new icons.

2008-08-05 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.5.8-svn-b27

 * Fix: Removed doubled function deinition.

2008-08-05 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.5.8-svn-b26

 *
 **
 *** SECURITY BUGFIX ****

 + Cross Site Scripting (XSS) +

 Login is now a separate page, not a popup.
 Verify userinput much more!


 + Application Account Lockout not Enforced +

 Account lockouts are not enforced over accounts once an excessive number of
 failed login attempts have been made.
 Gallery now locks such an account.


 * CHANGE: LOTS of CSS changes!

 * New class: Logins

 * New functions:
   - gHtmlSafe($string)
   - isValidGalleryUrl($url)
   - isValidText($text, $level = 0)

 * Change: Renamed isValidInteger() to isValidGalleryInteger()
           Also enhanced it.

  Now every userinput got from $_REQUEST is sanitized.

  Nice benefit is that HTML is now again possible in captions, titles, etc.

  The Team would like to thank Aditya Mooley for catching and reporting this.
  And giving us the time to fix it before going to public.

  Aditya Mooley is member of the Coppermine-Gallery Development team.
  So have a look at http://coppermine.sf.net, the page of our friendly competittion application.
