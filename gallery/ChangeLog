2004-10-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl3-cvs-b1

	* Fix: Security-related changes

2004-08-25  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-pl2

	* 1.4.4-pl2 release

2004-08-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl2-cvs-b5

	* Fix: Also _SERVER["HTTP_COOKIE"] in phpinfo.

2004-08-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl2-cvs-b4

	* Fix: Unset GRPC in phpinfo.php so that people don't accidentally post
	  confidential information to the forums

2004-08-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl2-cvs-b3

	* Fix: Completion of the new long filename fix (variable name typo in b1)

2004-08-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl2-cvs-b2

	* Fix: Incomplete merge of _GetStyleSheetLink caused failure to recognize
	  non-.default filenames.

2004-08-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl2-cvs-b1

	* Fix:  The longfilename / disclosure issue was completely broken in
	  way too many ways.

2004-08-20  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-pl1

	* 1.4.4-pl1 release

2004-08-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b18

	* Change: Extra error handling in Album::getHighlightTag
	  Blind stab at the 'incomplete delete and resize forms' issue
	  which appears to be failing inside getHighlightTag.

2004-08-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b17

	* Fix: Several small fixes.  Body text direction in poll_results,
	  CSS file location from subdirs (tools), No files/All files in setup,
	  stray binary char in setup, return to Gallery url in find_orphans,
	  recursive slideshow in albums with no photos (only albums)

	* Change:  Addition of Bharat's cache code - this is good, sooner rather
	  than later.

2004-08-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b16

	* Fix: Missing echo on gallery_error in save_photos from b14

	* Fix: Make doubly-sure that we're setting mambo session vars when
	  embedded, to prevent the 'No info' error.

2004-08-18  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b15

	* Fix: Added a setup option for "slowPhotoCount".  The accurate photo count
	  on the Gallery index page was a much requested change, however it proved to
	  be so slow on some machines/Galleries that this will disable it unless
	  explicitly enabled by the user during setup.  (Galleries with vast numbers
	  of albums or images could take as long as 30 seconds to load the index, by
	  user reports)

2004-08-17  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b14

	* Fix: Navigation bar width was dependant on whether images were resized or not...
	  this caused albums where resize_size was off to have the table width set to 0.

	* Fix: Extra-long filename prevention in save_photos.php, as well as verifying
	  that the uploaded file is a valid image format before saving to the temp
	  directory

2004-08-16  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b13

	* Fixed a typo in classes/Album.php (missing ')')

2004-08-16  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b12

	* Fix: If 'shutterfly' is set, but not checked, unset it during the
	  album upgrade.  This caused shutterfly to appear even though it wasn't
	  really enabled.

	* Change: Add copyright to modules.php

2004-08-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b11

	* Fix: Print fatal error message instead of obscure PHP error
	  when userDB fails to init before we try and use it.

2004-08-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b10

	* Fix: numAccessibleItems was incorrectly checking isHiddenRecurse()
	  for albums.  It needed to just be isHidden()

2004-08-06  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b9

	* Fix: Prevent foreach() error from being displayed when previewing
	  watermark previews.

	* Fix: Logging into Gallery as a non-admin and then trying to reset
	  the admin password failed.  The logged in user was used and the
	  resetadmin file was ignored

2004-08-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b8

	* Fix: Extract HTTP_POST_FILES in phpBB2's modules.php

	* Change: Remove modules.php.gz, add modules.php so that we can track
	  code changes.  There's no real reason for it to be gzip'ed.
	  - Updated HowTo.txt and removed 'unzip'...

2004-08-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b7

	* Fix: Correct the check_exec function which was being a little too liberal
	  in its regex for exec.  (shell_exec was incorrectly labeled as 'exec')

2004-08-01  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b6

	* Fix: Don't display clickable dimensions for movies

	* Fix: Stack the custom fields on top of each other - users were
	  really displeased by the side-by-side view

2004-07-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b5

	* Change: edit_appearance needs to properly handle the empty variable
	  without issuing any PHP notices/warnings
	  (Thanks for finding the issue, Tim)

2004-07-31  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b4

	* Fix: Disabling ALL print services in edit_appearance (album properties) did not work.

2004-07-31  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b3

	* Fix: Removed shorttags in classes/phpbb files

2004-07-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b2

	* Fix: The admin options on root albums were displaying inside the
	  Mambo UI.

2004-07-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-pl1-cvs-b1

        * Fix: view_comments would display albums without read permissions
          (user could not see anything except highlight image and album title)

2004-07-29  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4

	* 1.4.4 Release

2004-07-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b8

	* Fix: Typo in register.php prevented user registration

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b7

	* Fix: Prevent the random block from grabbing an album highlight as its
	  image.

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b6

	* Fix: Mambo popups failed to operate because the option var wasn't
	  set on systems with register_globals disabled - how did this
	  ever work?

	* Fix: Eliminate two shutterfly/print_photos notices in edit_appearance

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b5

	* Fix: We believe that this should fix the issue that some users have
	  had with extremely large Gallery installations during the upgrade
	  script, where the albums just don't show up on the page at all.

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b4

	* Fix: Display the 'view comments in nested album' links for all users
	  in commentboxtop.inc.  This was restricted to admin/owner only, so it
	  broke navigation when view comments was allowed for all users.

	* Change: Fix uninitialized variable notice

2004-07-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b3

	* Fix: Trim trailing spaces from setup vars where no-trailing-slash is
	  set.  This prevents the "/usr/bin /pnmtojpeg" issue

2004-07-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b2

	* Fix: The addition of the 'view comments' for everyone was exposing
	  hidden photos since view_comments.php had been written with only
	  the owner/admin in mind.

2004-07-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC4-cvs-b1

        * Change: Remove bastard newlines from delete_user and delete_album that were causing
          jscript errors in Firefox.

2004-07-25  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-RC3

	* 1.4.4-RC3 Release



	* Fix: Redirect in multi_create_user didnt worked after successfull adding.
	       Reason: doctype header was set before redirect header.

2004-07-23  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b9

        * Fix: Skins will be ignored when embedded.  This was causing a lot
          of display issues for users due to skin colors conflicting with
          embedding-system colors.

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b8

	* Fix?: Revert an earlier checkin (b100?) that prevented a PHP notice
	  when first loading sessions while embedded.  Some users report not
	  getting a session at all in postnuke.  Since postnuke was the original
	  problem, I'm confused, but this will work.  Supressing the notice using
	  @session_start()

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b7

	* Change: Remove the != SUNOS line from lib/lang.php
	  We're under the assumption that it was added based on a bogus
	  bug report some time ago because all docs (and user reports)
	  claim that the LANG= line is necessary.

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b6

        * Change: Better handling of the onsubmit/double-clicking issue
          utilizing an 'action' input which is changed depending on
          which button was clicked.

2004-07-21  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b5

	* Fix: Cancel did not work in create user.

	* Fix: Default language was not used for new users.

	* Change: Added $ Id $

	* Change: Modified HowTo and Changelog a very little.

	* Change: Added little description to block-random.php

2004-07-20  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b4

	* Fix: phpBB2 integration for the upload applet now works.

2004-07-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b3

        * Change: Check for fitToWindow before outputting the 'onclick'
          attribute in view_photo.

2004-07-20  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b2

	* Fix: Adapted contrib/phpBB2/modules.php to fit with phpBB2 2.0.9/10
	       and Register Globals ON.

2004-07-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC3-cvs-b1

        * Change: Since we no longer do shutterfly donations, 
          $gallery->app->default["print_photos"] can end up being ""
          which causes the key() in view_photo to fail.  This prevents
          the error message from key() and prevents printing of a blank
          print href.

2004-07-18  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-RC2

	* 1.4.4-RC2 Release

2004-07-18  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b22

	* Change: Minor fix for view_album optimizations

2004-07-16  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b21

        * Change: Revert last change to album_permissions

        * Change: Fix PHP5 - they stopped using the old-style GET and POST
          globals, and have switched to SuperGlobals only.  A couple session
          and form functions needed adapting.

2004-07-16  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b20

        * Change: album_permissions - if $gallery->album is not set, but
          set_albumName is, load it.

2004-07-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b19

        * Change: We no longer use the 'donation' option with Shutterfly,
          since we have an official affiliate agreement with them, now.
          - Remove the 'donation' option from the config wizard
          - Remove the 'donation' option from the album properties
          - Rev the album version and remove the donation flag
          - Fix setup text about donations/shutterfly

        * Change: Minor text tweak for upgrade album text in albums.php

        * Change: Fix unset variable error in print code.

2004-07-15  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b18

	* Change: Adapted contrib/phpBB2/modules.php to fit with phpBB2 2.0.9
	
	* Fix: added missing ; after a &quot

2004-07-15  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b17

	* Fix: change $noHeader to sendHeader in lib/lang.php and init with true instead false.
	       Caught by Joerg Holzapfel 

2004-07-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b16

        * Change: Don't try and create clickable dimensions on albums.

2004-07-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b15

	* Change: Give clickable dimensions their own table row so that they
	  don't end up in a situation where they're *beside* the image

	* Change: $album->save() after rehighlight in makeThumbnail() so new size is saved.
	  (by mindless)

2004-07-14  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b14

	Fix: Use getImagePath for voting result bars.
	     Voting bars were not skinable. (caught by Jade)

2004-07-13  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b13

        * Fix: Added missing " in albums.php.
          This caused every link after find orphans to be b0rked.

        * Fix: Added missing / to link to configwizard.

2004-07-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b12

        * Change: Add a 'rssMaxAlbums' option to the RSS page in the config wizard,
          specifying the maximum number of changed albums to be returned in
          the feed.  Defaults to 25.

        * Change: Try and optimize the number of times we use isHiddenRecurse and
          canReadRecurse when populating the RSS data

2004-07-12  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b11

	* Fix: hidden albums are now indicated as such in fetch-album-images (GR protocol)

2004-07-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b10

        * Change: Hidden images/albums could be *too* hidden (owner couldn't see them)

        * Change: slideshow validation URL is based on whether you're looking at an
          album, or the gallery-wide show.

        * Typo: Another photoAlbumUrl -> photoAlbumURL
          (so much for variables being case insensitive)

2004-07-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b9

        * Typo: photoAlbumURL not photoAlbumUrl

2004-07-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b8

        * Change: $adminCommands links now use CSS to prevent breaks in
          two-word links. (e.g. "[manage users]")

        * Change: Change 'one' to '1' to maintain consistancy

        * Change: Clear up to possible PHP notices for use_exif being
          unset.

	* Change: Add find_orphans to include list (from Tim)

	* Change: Correct config wizard link (from Tim)

2004-07-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b7

        * Change: Check the UserDB for consistancy before logging into
          the config wizard.

2004-07-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b6

        * Change: Incorrect variable assignment in view_album optimization
          could yield hidden photos viewable

2004-07-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b5

        * Change: Center the block-random image, to match the text

2004-07-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b4

        * Change: Update security message to mention secure.sh, and only
          appear on non-Windows OSes.

2004-07-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b3

        * Change: Logout with relative URLs would return a redirect error
          due to doubling of the photoAlbumUrl 

2004-07-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b2

	* Change: Another case of relying on the submit button for a value,
	  but it's now disabled

2004-07-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-RC2-cvs-b1

	* Change: Check POST vars for $include before resetting to 'albums.php'

2004-07-10  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-RC1

	* v1.4.4 Release Candidate 1

	* Change: Fix the validation links in each

2004-07-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b246

	* Change: Make gallery.footer, album.footer and photo.footer all
	  the same.  The slight differences between them caused text variation
	  in different skins.  (Besides, there's no reason they shouldn't be.)

2004-07-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b245

	* Change: Backwards params on eregi()

2004-07-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b244

	* Change: Verify !empty() for the exec() status on the check page.

	* Change: Typo in AlbumItem

	* Change: Add link to find_orphans beside config wizard for admins

2004-07-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b242

	* Change: Give Random Block a configuration variable for cache timeout

2004-07-08  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b241

	* Change: Problem with upgrading - photos weren't being loaded prior
	  to running integrityCheck.

	* Change: During integrityCheck, set $gallery->album to the current album
	  because AlbumItem::integrityCheck relies on it to get the current album

	* Change: Fix a couple PHP notices for unset variables

2004-07-08  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b240

	* Change: Add a check for exec() being disabled in the check section
	  of the config wizard.

	* AUTHORS: Obfuscated all email addresses

2004-07-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b238

	* Change: User/IntegrityCheck 
	  We want assignment, not equality.  (= not ==)

2004-07-03  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b237

	* Fix: Done the same for register.php

2004-07-02  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b236

	*  Fix: Delete Photo/Album was b0rked, because disabled Buttons are not sent when commit.
			But we tested for the commit Button. Added hidden field which is set on submit.

2004-07-01  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b235

	* Change: Don't recursively run through each album to find albums
	  requiring upgrades when we already have a complete list...

2004-07-01  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b234

	* 978315: Add 'onsubmit' flags to disable the submit buttons on
	  critical forms to prevent double-clicking.

	* Change: Fix syntax error in adv_search.php (even though we're
	  not using it yet)

2004-07-01  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b233

	* 969218: Attempt to prevent detection of binaries that don't
	  actually exist.  Make sure the located path is not empty.

	* Change: Whitespace, don't call phpversion() again, it's already
	  in a local variable.

2004-07-01  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b232

	* Fix: html_entity_decode doesnt support utf-8

2004-06-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b231

	* Change: Minor opt to numVisibleItems() - cache the uid of the
	  user, instead of calling getUid() inside the loop.

2004-06-30  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b230

	* Change: Text changes, made some untranslateable phrases translateable, 
		  changed \" to &quot; in translateable texts.

	* Change: Correct < > to HTML encoding in button text

	  JS errors

	* Change: Text casing fix

	* Change: Move adminCommentsEmail and adminOtherChangesEmail into
	  the email section of the config wizard and unhide them.

2004-06-29  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b227

	* Fix: In Linux, PHP with gettext and only system locales installed
	       that maybe fit (en_US.utf8 or de_DE.ISOwhatever) 
	       config reported that no suitable locales where found.

	* Change: Enhancements for locale aliases. Empty values are allowed and will be removed from config.
		  ***** This needs testing !! *****

2004-06-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b226

	* Change: view_album - variable name conflict

	* Change: index - Kludge for postnuke .75 (RC3) - they're no longer
	  exporting GET variables (ala register_globals), which is better
	  security, but broke our 'include' variable.

2004-06-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b225

	* Change: view_album optimization for large albums by Mark Curly from
	  gallery-devel.  I've tested this, but it will need a real good look
	  during code freeze and RC.

2004-06-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b224

	* Change: Update the check.inc messages to reflect the 'php_value' 
	  error correctly, instead of saying that it's a mod_rewrite error.

2004-06-27  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b223

	* Fix: Mambo (Form) Photo-Upload was broken, because we loaded the popup without be called
	       through Mambo. So Mambo-Information were lost.
	       Infos are now stored in session when calling makeGalleryUrl with option popup.
	       Those infos are erased when Gallery is loaded "normal" the next time.

	* Fix: Gallery didnt recognized logout from Mambo.

	* New: Add Text in configwizard to remind user to switch off Debug Mode

2004-06-26  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b222

	* Change: Don't have gallery_mail() print out the email even when
	  we're in debug mode.  This can cause unintended security issues.

2004-06-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b221

	* Change:  Dumbest bug evar!  Don't re-initialize $albumDB on every call
	  to a recursive-calling function.  It's slower than you can possibly imagine.

2004-06-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b220

	* Change:  "!isset($page)" to "empty($page)"
	  http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=81113#81113

2004-06-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b219

	* Change: sessions - phpNuke requires session_start(), postNuke errors
	  on it.  Check...

	* Change: Match casing on 'configuration wizard' for admin links

2004-06-25  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b218

	* Change: A litte less tables in view_album and some minor changes for layout of caption

2004-06-25  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b217

	* Fix: Gallery didnt recognized a log out from GeekLog

2004-06-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b216

	* Add: Random Block - added and updated to use our save serialization
	  functions

	* Change: album->canReadRecurse() - change "global $albumDB" to a new
	  albumDB, since not all callers have established an albumDB.

2004-06-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b215

	* Change: Suppress non-essential ini_set() error message, if server disallows
	  ini_set()

	* Change: Only execute start_session() if we're not embedded.
	  When embedded, this throws an "already started" error message with devMode on.

2004-06-24 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b214

	* Fix: Bug #978297; User-Language was not saved for selfregisterd users.

	* Fix: Added missing ereg Paramater introduced in b210

2004-06-22  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b211

	* Fixed typo in upload (and slideshow) applets for Geeklog.

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b210

	* Change: config wiz - try and find a closer match to the requested
	  language for locale aliases.  If we don't find a really close match,
	  fall back to a semi-close one.  (Check for "en_US" before falling back to
	  "en", etc.)

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b209

	* Bug 977777: If newName and oldName are the same, just close the
	  dialog

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b208

	* Change: view_album - unset $myAlbum if item isn't an album so that
	  we don't carry it over to the next item

	* Change: un-revert printChildren opt, it was correct

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b207

	* Bugfix: #962176; Print <No Caption> under photos only for logged In Admins or owner
	
2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b205

	* Change: Minor performance enhancements - don't load photos when
	  we don't need to! (Probably more of these coming.)

2004-06-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b204

	* Change: Add wordwrapping for comments as a failsafe, in case of
	  pre-1.4.4 abusive comments.

	* Change: Modify text for comments_length in config wiz to note that
	  we have a hard limit of 1000 chars.

2004-06-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b203

	* Fix: Prevent abnormally large comments from being entered.
	  New limits:  100 chars for name, 1000 chars for comment

2004-06-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b202

	* Change: Performance enhancement for getNextPhoto() - we don't need
	  to load the photos for subalbums when we're checking permissions,
	  we only need the album itself.  Cuts our getFile() calls in half.

2004-06-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b201

	* Fix: Out of Bounds error in postnuke

	* Change:  Add "\r\n" to a mail() additional header, just in case.
	  (It shouldn't be needed, since it's the only header)

2004-06-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b200

	* Change: Add option to set default album permissions to 
	  "loggedin" instead of "everybody"

2004-06-18  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b199

	* Bug 969046: Prevent an impatient user from deleting two albums
	  at once by clicking the form submit twice.

2004-06-17 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b198

	* Fix: Alttext works again (Stupid_j forgot return)

2004-06-17 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b197

	* Change: Removed function isSupportedCharset which was added in b185

	* New/Change: Added function gallery_htmlentities

	* Fix: Removed PHP Warning when URL or path for uploading photos is not valid

2004-06-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b195

	* Fix: Change the global "$sessionVar" to something which won't confuse
	  the config wizard and create a $gallery->app->sessionVar string
	  which gets longer on each re-configuration.

	* Change: Correct the session cookie names in add_photos and slideshow so that
	  they have the underscore before their name.  "gallery_sessionaddphotos_mode"
	  was kind of unappealing to look at.

2004-06-15 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b194

	* New: Added outOfDateAlbums to AlbumDB. 
	       It contains the names of all Albums that are out of Date.

	* Change: Dont show a "upgrade" link to every outdated album, 
		  instead add a bigger warning on mainpage.

2004-06-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b193

	* Change: PHP 5 changes, small optimization, additional security checks

2004-06-15 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b192

	* Change: Album Property Border-width from "off" to 0
	  - increased album and config version

	* Change: indention in
	  - html_wrap/slideshow.header.default
	  - layout/navtablebegin.inc
	  - layout/navtablemiddle.inc
	  - layout/navtableend.inc

	* Change: Slideshow low and high use the bordercolor and borderwidth defined in properties.

	* Fix: Border was not always correct in layout/breadcrumb.inc

2004-06-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b191

	* Change:  strcmp() to strcasecmp() due to PHP5 behavior of retaining
	  capitalization returned from un/serialize()

2004-06-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b190

	* Change:  Add a '10' option to "rows" in config wizard to match
	  the album properties page.  (Bug 970087)

2004-06-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b189

	* Change: Add set_time_limit() to init.php to cover situations
	  where we don't explicitly reset the timer.  If the user increases
	  the default timer, it will cover all of Gallery, not just the specific
	  points that we call it for.  By calling set_time_limit() for specific
	  processes, we just reset the timer so that things can take longer.

2004-06-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b188

	* Change: Minor optimization in Album->setHighlight()

	* Change: Extra checking in AlbumItem->setHighlight() to 
	  try and prevent issues with movies.  Upgrade/Movie error is
	  still unreproduceable.

2004-06-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b187

	* New: Added Config option to allow everybody to see the comment overview, not only admins.

	* Fix: removed bold border around adminbox in some cases.

2004-06-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b186

	* Change: history.go(0) to location.reload() as a possible fix for
	  Mozilla not refreshing the album after upload in embedded environs.

2004-06-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b185

	* Fix: Removed some warnings in save_photo

	* Fix: Added new function isSupportedCharset and 3rd Paramater for htmlentities
	  Fixes: #964327

	* Change: Removed link on actual language flag according to:
		http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20031222.html # 10

2004-06-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b184

	* Add:  Re-add secure.sh and configure.sh ... should never
	  have removed them in the first place - they'll be necessary/nice
	  for upgrades.  Also for security-minded people who want to chmod
	  config.php and .htaccess to unwriteable states.  Modified secure.sh
	  to not chmod 0 setup, and to remove setup/resetadmin if it's present.

2004-06-09 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b183

	* New: Add Link to Config Wizard for logged in Admins on Startpage

	* Fix: Gallery didnt work when Users have NO language installed an PHP <= 4.2.0 and/or without gettext

	* Change: Moved Upload mode into group mandatory.

	* Change: Some little text changes in config.

2004-06-08  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b182

	* Change:  Add an 'uploadMode' option to config wizard to define which
	  method to default to for add_photos.

	* Fix:  Make sure that the user_version is set correctly for new users and for
	  the userdb to prevent the 'upgrading users' notice on a new install.

2004-06-08 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b181

	* Fix: Javascript for next/prev Tabs was not correct initialisized.
	  (Caught by Christian M.)

	* Change: Remove two references to configure_instructions.php

2004-06-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b178

	* Change: Switch image/album counter to the improved numAccessibleItems()

	* Change: Fix a pluralize_n2/ngettext issue.

2004-06-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b177

	* Change: Text updates to config wizard, cause wizard to forget Guid
	  if the resetadmin file is removed after it's set, remove bad require()

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b176

	* Change: Enable session-based GUID checking for "resetadmin" as
	  suggested by bharat

	* Change: Re-ran manifest to get rid of the recently removed files,
	  and as a general version update.

2004-06-03 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b175
	
	* Change: Tweaked again setup/login.inc

	* Change: Wording for messages when unconfigured or reconfiure is needed

	* Change: Removed unused files from error/

2004-06-02 Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b174

	* Fix: Bug#962076, add "watermark" to "admin options" drop down menu.

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b173

	* Fix: Config wizard - Using a valid admin account would log you 
	  in, even with a bad password.

2004-06-03 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b172

	* Change: Removed Caption for Custom Fields

	* Change: dos2unix setup/ folder

	* Change: Layout of setup/login.inc

	* Fix: login.inc didnt recognized a new login after logout from Gallery 
	

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b171

	* Change: functionalize login requirement to configLogin() in
	  functions.inc with a single parameter of "basename(__FILE__)"
	  so that it can tell which file it's posting back to.

	* Change: Add session support to setup/init.php so that the admin
	  only has to log in once, instead of once for each php module.

	* Change: Add authorization requirement to all setup/* modules
	  (excluding frame_test, since there's no real reason)

	* Change: Removed configure.bat/sh and secure.bat/sh from manifest.inc
	  (I don't think this matters?  They'd be removed on the manifest rebuild
	  anyway, right?)

2004-06-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b170

	* Change: Tweaked publish_XP Docs

	* Fix: Removed Warning in search when Gallery is embedded

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b169

	* Change: Add a method for admin password recovery -
	  If the file "setup/resetadmin" exists, the login requirement
	  is bypassed

	* Change: Remove the permissions check from gallerySanityCheck()

	* Change: Remove configure.(bat|sh) and secure.(bat|sh)

	  the Gallery configuration will not be secure until they remove "resetadmin"

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b168

	* Change:  Add user security to config wizard (!!)
	  If a Gallery has been configured, require the user to login as
	  an admin before allowing them to reconfigure using the config wizard.
	  Users configuring for the first time are allowed to bypass the login
	  requirement.

	  Still needed:  A method to reset the administrator password if it's lost.

2004-06-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b167

	* New: Enable mod_rewrite for GeekLog

	* Fix: Removed warnings in publish_xp

	* Change: Change Text "Error Messages" to "Debug Messages"

	* New: publish_xp is now available for GeekLog

2004-06-01  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-165

	* Fix: Major security issue with init.php, which allowed anybody
	  to login as any user (including admin) with no password, by 
	  emulating that Gallery was embedded.

2004-06-01  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b164

	* Change: Clear up some PHP_NOTICEs in the config wizard

	* Change: view_album.php - Change a dynamic sort function into 
	  a static one to save time and make debugging easier.

2004-05-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b163

	* Change: Move guid generation explicitly to album creation, and
	  photo add/delete to save processing time.

	* Change: Correct photo count on albums.php to not include albums

2004-06-01  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b162

	* Fix: Bug #959948.
	  Thanks to "darkunderdog".

2004-05-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b161

	* Change: Text spacing change in albums.php

	* Change: Extra check in canReadRecursive() to deal with a weird
	  issue that h0bbel found with an orphan.

2004-05-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b160

	* Change: GUID needs to be added to new albums on creation, otherwise
	  the RSS is generated with a blank guid field (if no photos have been
	  added to the new album)

2004-05-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b159

	* Bug 921262:  Add -trim to jpegtran rotation options to prevent
	  artifacting when images don't match the "normal" dimensions

	* Bug 852395:  If the user navigates to a new album while editing 
	  captions, throw an error and abort changes.  This *could* be adapted
	  to just load the correct album, however if they've navigated, we
	  don't know if they have modified that album or not.

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b158

	* Change: Better detection of which pubDate to use for RSS feeds

	* Change: Implement canReadRecurse() in search.php - you now
	  cannot search for any album which you can not directly link to
	  from an albums page.

	* Change: Flag 'autoRotated' after manual rotation to prevent this:
	  Use has autorotate disabled.  Uploads a photo.  Manually rotates
	  it to proper orientation.  Later enables autorotate.  Moves photo.
	  ... if autoRotate isn't flagged, the move will cause autorotate to
	  rotate it, even though it was done manually.

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b157

	* Change: Text fix for RSS option in config_data

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b156

	* Change: Add "canReadRecurse" to Album - use canReadRecurse in RSS feed
	  to optimize the "albumFindable" call that was in the original RSS.php

	* Change: Fix casing on getAlbumByName.  More occurances were using the 
	  upper-cased "by" than not, so this is an official correction

2004-05-28  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b155

	* Fix: Removed warning in Config Wizard, when no config.php is there.

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b154

	* Change: Add field "guid" to Album which is used by RSS to
	  determine if an item is new.  The guid is updated with each
	  photo upload.

	* Change: Add extraField "autoRotated" to AlbumItem
	  This field is checked to determine if we have already rotated
	  an item before so that we don't do it again on an item move.

	* Change: album_version was revved to 29 for both of these changes

2004-05-27  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b153

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in Geeklog.

2004-05-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b152

	* Fix:  Correct URL to rss.php when in embedded mode.  We can't
	  use makeGalleryUrl() since that links to an embedded rss.php
	  which really isn't usable.

	* Change:  Remove an unnecessary if block from rss.php

2004-05-27  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b151

	* Change: Add watermark on upload support, form and URL upload only.

	* Fix: Do not set recursive, unless displaying form.  Attempts to
	  fix bug #958542, watermarking: exclude subalbums not working.
	  (Thanks to primedomain) 

2004-05-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b150

	* Fix: rss.php now correctly retrieves highlights which are set
	  in a sub-album, rather than the target album itself.

2004-05-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b149

	* Fix: Remove border=1 from gallery.footer, added in last checkin

	* Fix: Remove warnings in rss.php when in dev mode an not reconfigured.

	* Change: Little text change.

2004-05-25  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b146

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in PHPNuke.
	  Other CMSs may need more work. The applets are confirmed to work
	  with PHPNuke and PostNuke.

2004-05-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b145

	* Change: rss.php config options mostly migrated to config wizard.

2004-05-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b144

	* Change:  Add "php_value session.save_handler files" to 
	  the php_values.template to proactively prevent some of the 
	  cases where it's set to "user" system-wide.

	* Change: Add a developer-file hook to init.php.  If the file
	  "lib/devel.php" is present on your local system, it will be 
	  included near the top of init.php.  It's a logical location for
	  code profiling modules and such that shouldn't be checked into
	  CVS, but you don't want getting overwritten with each cvs up.

2004-05-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b143

	* Change: Only display visible (non-hidden) albums

	* Change: Fix PHP shorttags

	* Change: Text changes

	* Note: Lots of whitespace changes - use "diff -w -r1.1 -r1.2"
	  to see the real changes

2004-05-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b142

	* Add:  Initial version of Cody Smith's RSS Generator
	  Based on rss.php 0.4 - Migration to config.php variables next

2004-05-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b141

	* Change:  Accidentally committed debug code in init.php - removing

2004-05-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b140

	* Change: Use makeGalleryHeaderUrl() instead of makeGalleryUrl() in
	  makeFormIntro due to the fact that we, later in the function, split
	  parameters based on "&"

2004-05-23  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b139

	* Change:
	  !!  2004-05-23:   adv_search.php has been broken
	  !!  for an unknown amount of time.  Since it has
	  !!  no references from outside files, it will 
	  !!  automatically redirect to albums.php until
	  !!  it can be fixed

2004-05-23  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b138

	* Change: Items which are children of hidden parents can not be located
	  using search.php.  I extensively debugged and profiled this to ensure that
	  it is being called as few times as possible.  Recursion is only called on 
	  matching objects.

2004-05-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b137

	* Change: Create watermark preview files with an incrementing number.
	  This prevent an issue where the preview doesn't reload after modification
	  due to smart browser caching.

	  This change required addition of a generic glob() function for PHP < 4.3.0
	  so that the old preview files can be removed when creating a new one, or
	  when finalizing the watermark. (PHP >= 4.3 uses the native glob())

2004-05-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b136

	* Change: Watermarking code was missing some quotes around "checked"
	  in several locations

2004-05-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b135

	* Change: A couple "&nbsp" => "&nbsp;" text fixes

	* 957300: Prevent two different-format images from being uploaded
	  with the same basename.  (i.e.  hello.jpg and hello.gif don't both
	  end up being tagged as "hello")

2004-05-21  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b134

	* Change: Revert part of b129. Only Album title is now a link.

	* Fix: Removed warning in view_photo

	* Change: show "no Caption" in view_photo, if photo has no caption

	* Fix: removed default class in function showChoice in view_album, 
	       due to unreadable pulldown menu in some skins.

2004-05-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b133

	* Change: Add a check to available_skins() to fix URLs when 
	  photoAlbumURL isn't set yet

	* Change: Un-hide devMode in the Technical section of the
	  config wizard, with a warning for non-PHP-savvy users

	* Change: Fix typo in config wizard text

2004-05-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b132

	* Change: Revert xhtml

2004-05-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b131

	* Change: docType() now returns XHTML 1.0 Transitional

	* Change: Beginning of translation to XHTML 1.0 Transitional
	  albums.php validates, when albumTree is turned off

2004-05-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b130

	* Change: Add missing text to phpBB2 manual-howto

	* Change: Descriptive text for find_orphans

2004-05-19  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b129

	* New: Album title, photo and movie captions are now links in view_album.

2004-05-18  Christian Mohn <h0bbel@p0ggel.org>  1.4.4-cvs-b128
	
	* Fix: Changed view_photo.php to show the photoname, and not the index if there
	  is no custom field called Title 

	* Vanity: Added myself to AUTHORS. :)

2004-05-18  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b127

	* Fix: Use of htmlentities(unhtmlentities()) for Alttext of photos

2004-05-18  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b126

	* Fix: Added missing global $gallery in function itemLastCommentDate($i)

	* New: Applied idea of Patch #869056

	* New: Added possibility to have additional Attributes for the link on photos.

	* Change: removed unused(?) code in view_photo ($openAnchor)

	* Fix: Use of unhtmlentities() for Alttext of photos

	* Change: Only put metatag with keyword(s) if there we have keyword(s)

2004-05-17  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b125

	* Fix: [View comments] links were disabled even when comments
	  existed in a (sub)album if "Indicate if there are comments
	  available" config option was set to photos and probably off.

	* Change: Pass $gallery->app->comments_indication_verbose as a
	  parameter so some calls to lastCommentDate() can use "no" to see
	  if comments exist.

2004-05-17  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b124

	* Change: Rewrite of getNextPhoto() by Adventure
	  This should be a decent speed optimization, as well as
	  fixing one edge case.  (Though I'm not sure where it was 
	  being missed in the original.) Formatting tweaks and commenting 
	  by me.

2004-05-17  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b123

	* Change: Adjust Layout of upgrade_albums

	* Fix: Removed unneeded htmlentity stuff in edit_appearance.php 
	  which caused troubled in unsupported charsets.

	* Change: Some translation related changes.

2004-05-16  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b122

	* Fixed a typo since -b112 in captionator.php that was preventing the
	  page from rendering.

2004-05-16  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b121

	* Change: Add watermark preview.  Disable links to watermark
	  album when album is empty. Alignment using X and Y coordinates
	  can use percents.
	* Fix:  Watermark alignment defaults to lower right instead of
	  nothing.  Watermarks incorrectly clipped to the bottom.

2004-05-16  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b120

	* Change: Users in manage_users.php are now sorted.

2004-05-15  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b119

	* Change: Add recursive watermark of albums.

2004-05-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b118

	* Change: Better missing parent detection, minor text changes

2004-05-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b117

	* Fix: Actually enable attachOrphans(), since I'd forgotten to pass its
	  variable

2004-05-14  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b116

	* Fix: Double echo in setup/confirm.inc.
	  Thanks to Terje.

2004-05-14  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b115

	*  Change: Beautification and translateable tools/find_orphans.php

2004-05-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b114

	* Change:  tools/find_orphans.php now uses a form to gather confirmation
	  from the user before performing any changes.  It does not yet support 
	  customized-reattachment.

2004-05-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b113

	* Add:  Initial web-accessible version of find_orphans.php
	  - Does not yet prompt for verification
	  - Orphans are returned to their original parent
	    If the parent is missing they are turned into root albums
	  - Secured so that only admins can access it

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b112

	* Fix: Some counter didnt work, due to wrong use of pluralize_n2

	* Change: Complete replace of pluralize_n with n2

	* Fix: Typo in function galleryDocs

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b111

	* Fix: Don't use strict numPhotos where it was being used!
	  Damaging to albums that contain no images (only sub-albums)

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b110

	* Fix: - Check for ngettext installed
	  - Translation was not correct caught.

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b109

	* Fix: Forgot the "empty" case for the strict photo counting.

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b108

	* New: Introduced first steps of ngettext

	* Fix: reused name="photo_j"

	* Change: return of browserLanguage()

	* New: Additional Paramter for initLanguage()

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b107

	* Change: Add an optional flag to Album::numPhotos() to do strict
	  counting of photos - this prevents albums from being counted as
	  images for the "total" on albums.php

	* Change: Another _SERVER -> HTTP_SERVER_VARS

	* Change: ChangeLog beautification by the compulsive developer

2004-05-12 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b106

	* Fix: Use of $HTTP_SERVER_VARS instead $_SERVER

	* Fix: Parse Error in do_command

2004-05-11  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b105

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in a CMS.
	* Applets now attempt to use the same language as the Gallery (GR language
	  support is sorely lacking at the moment).
	* Integrated applets version 1.4-b10, which also contain many improvements to
	  slideshow and upload. Please see GR ChangeLog for more details.

2004-05-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b104

	* Change: Enable optional syslog reporting for login/out

2004-05-10  Alan Harder <alan.harder@sun.com>  1.4.4-cvs-b103

	* Regenerate highlights as needed when moving albums around.

2004-05-10  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b102

	* Fixed alt="..." attribute in <img> tags to strip out HTML and then
	  convert double quotes to HTML entities. Previously, displaying image
	  captions with HTML or double quotes would output malformed HTML.
	  (Introduced in 1.4.4-cvs-b72 when we added the caption text to the
	  alt attribute.)

2004-05-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b101

	* Change:  Use unhtmlentities() instead of strtr() - this allows
	  us to use html_entity_decode() if it's present

2004-05-07  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b100

	* Change:  Add missing piece of JS for the localGetElementsByTagName()
	  code

2004-05-06  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b99

	* Fix: Links to docs and diagnostics(!) didnt work with empty config.php
	  ($gallery->app->photoAlbumURL is not set)

2004-05-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b98

	* Change: JS shim to make getElementsByTagName() less browser
	  version dependant

2004-05-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b97

	* Change: Config wizard now starts with submit buttons disabled.  They
	  are enabled during document.onload using JavaScript.  This will
	  prevent errors from occuring due to people pressing Next before the page has
	  completed loading, thereby not sending all of the config data to the next page.

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b96

	* Fix: Warning in when recovering password with adding isset to userData.inc.
		Thanks to floridave.

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b95

	* Change: Allow doCommand("delete-comment") to use the $return
	  var

	* Change: Extra debug output when using dismissAndLoad() to
	  display $url for troubleshooting.

	* Change: Correct "view_album" to "view_photo" in commentdraw.inc

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b94

	* Fix: Adjust util.php due to renamed config option.
	
	* Change: removed unused/debug code.

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b93

	* New: Added config option for maximum length of comments.

	* Change: Rewrite of navigator.inc and navphoto.inc

	* Fix: Images for Voting Result Graph were not found when embedded.

	* Fix: Removed Bigger border around breadcrumb when not on search page. (Introduced in b81)

	* Changes in setup/frame_test.php:
	  - Corrected use of doctype();
	  - Use of init.php
	  - Use of constant GALLERY_BASE
	  - Use of $HTTP_GET_VARS, because $_GET is only available for PHP >=4.1.0
	  - Use of common_header()

	* Change: Created function drawCommentAddForm which is used inside and in popup 
		  for unified Layout.

	* Change: Moved substitution for array_search when PHP <4.0.5 from
		  view_photo.php into util.php so we can use it everywhere.

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b92

	* Change: Don't use makeGalleryHeaderUrl in do_command "logout"
	  if it's a full url.  (Checking for "^http")

	* Change: Remove extraneous htmlspecialchars() from inline_imagewrap

	* Change: Use doCommand() and add "full" param to popup() in 
	  commentbox.inc and commentdraw.inc to prevent a refresh from
	  occuring, which can cause an issue using the new inline comments.
	  (Post a comment, immediately delete it,  it would attempt to re-post
	  the comment - fixed)

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b91

	* Change: Add an isset() to inline_imagewrap.inc

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b90

	* Change: "width" is not a valid property for <p>

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b89

	* Change:  Remove one more htmlspecialchars() from a location
	  where it might be called twice on one URL

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b88

	* Change: Remove independant htmlspecialchars() calls and move
	  it to a central location in makeGalleryUrl().  The only reason
	  htmlspecialchars() should be called is if make*Url() is not
	  appropriate.

	* Change: Add makeGalleryHeaderUrl() and makeAlbumHeaderUrl()
	  These functions decode the htmlspecialchars() which makeGalleryUrl()
	  calls, since html entities aren't valid in HTTP headers.  It's a
	  somewhat redundant operation, but necessary for code usability.

	* Change: Update all Location: headers to use the make*HeaderUrl()
	  functions.

2004-05-03  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b87

	* Change: Add frame test page that allows the user to preview
	frames before selecting them.

	* Change: inline_imagewrap.inc can now be passed a base directory
	for relative links of the frame images.

	* Fix: Added style="height:<?php echo $hRR ?>px" to frames,
	 height="..." was removed for compliant HTML.

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b86

	* Change: Use " " instead of "<wbr>" to break comment lines.
	  (Jens pointed out that wbr isn't valid html.)

	* Fix: Remove extra " from navphoto.inc

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b85

	* Fix: We now make the assumption, when loading the userdb, that
	  the file is user_version 4.  This will ensure that if for some reason
	  (most notably, the userfile format revision from 1.3->1.4)
	  the correct version number is not unserialized from the file, that we
	  will perform the necessary file-format upgrade

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b84

	* Change:  Prevent long comments from creating horizontal scroll
	  by using wordwrap() to add <wbr> tags.

	* Change:  Make 'Popup' be the default comment method.  Changing
	  our default behavior isn't the best option unless the user wants it.

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b83

	* Change: Extra check to determine whether quoting popups is
	  appropriate, since embedded URLs don't use absolute pathing.

2004-05-02 Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b82

	* Change: Disable view_comments when album does not contain any comments.

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b81

	* Fix: Border was not correct around breadcrumb table.

	* Change: HTML and UI beautification and valid HTML in search.php

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b80

	* New: Add possibility to add comments without popup, but inside view_photo

	* Change: Beatified appereance of comments.

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b79

	* Change: Moved all voting functions from util.php to lib/voting.php

	* Change: Tweaked view_photo.php

	* Change: Added function displayPhotoFields() so we a unified display.

	* Fix: Wrong filename for validation in extra_fields.php

2004-05-01 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b78

	* Fix: Corrected Typo that causes Poll result not be displayed.
	       (Introduced in 1.4.4-cvs-b66/67)

2004-05-01 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b77

	* New: Added isLoggedIn to phpBB2 Users.

	  in the <input> tags.  Thanks to Asher Choen for finding this.

2004-04-30  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-75
	
	* Change: Use strnatcasecmp instead of strnatcmp in sorting by filename
	  and caption (Tracker #945228)

2004-04-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b74

	* Fix: Missing )

2004-04-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b73

	* Change: Remove unused function parameter from AlbumItem::getPhotoId()
	  and Image::getId() - Thanks to Adventure for finding this

	  http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=16143

2004-04-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b72

	* New: Added extra field for Alttext/title/onMouseover.

	* Change: Added optional paramter to getExtraFields in Album.php.
		  If set to false not all extra Fields are returned.

	* Change: Tweaked getThumbnailTag, getHighlightTag and getPhotoTag to work with alttext.

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b71

	* Change: Renamed get_GalleryPathes() to getGalleryPaths() 
	  to fix spelling and uniformity of naming

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b70

	* Change: Correct the identification of the movie.thumb path
	  (get_GalleryPathes() is called in init.php)

2004-04-28  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b69

	* gallery_remote2.php: when an album is set to not allow the user
	  to view full-sized pictures, but there is no resized picture,
	  do allow to view full-sized, because it's the same as resized.
	  This appears to be what the web UI does.

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b68

	* Change: More beatification in resize_photo.php

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b67

	* Change: Forgot some $GALLERY_BASEDIR. Now its complete free.

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b66

		  into <?php common_header(); ?>

	* Change: popup_js, redux. Only quote the string if it contains
	  (^http|^ftp).  JS functions don't like to be quoted.

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b64

	* Change: Properly quote popup_js's return URL and escape quotes
	  which would otherwise break the string early.

2004-04-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b63

	* Change: Move htmlspecialchars() to prevent JS url break
	  ---- REVERTED

2004-04-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b62

	* Change: Rename "ROOT" option in move scripts to ".root" to 
	  prevent interaction with a user album, which could be named
	  "ROOT"
	  - All user-viewable (translatable) text is unchanged; "ROOT"
	    still makes sense, visually.

	  way it's intended. $gallery->album is referring to the album
	  being moved, not the parent album.  getNestedAlbum returns
	  the number of photos inside the album being moved - 
	  if the index of the album being moved (inside its parent)
	  is larger than the number of photos inside the album being
	  moved, then getAlbumName will return an out of bounds error

 	* Recommit of ImageTools.jar (same as 1.4.2-cvs-b73, which apparently
	  was the wrong version of the jar).  Namely: no code changes, but the
	  code is now compiled under jdk1.1 for broader compatibility
	  (specifically it now works with the MS Java VM that comes with
	  Windows XP)

2004-03-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b111

	  k-man discovered that if galleryTitle isn't set (or is "")
	  it has the same effect as disabling returnTo on single-level
	  albums, since the anchor is displayed empty.

2004-03-03  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b90

	* Added new Spiral Notebook frame.  Thanks to carlandtracey.com;

	  and check for uninitialized variables as well.

	* Bug 851148: Fix 'unknown' error which occurs when using left/right navigation
	  in an album with hidden photos.  This removes albums from the navigation entirely,
	  since it doesn't make sense for them to be in there.

	  before we tried to resize/highlight them.

	* Other:  Check for variable initialization in edit_thumb.php

	* Other:  Redirect not-logged-in users to albums.php if they attempt to navigate
	  to upgrade_albums.php.  Previously, a blank page was displayed.

	* Other:  Variable name change in popup_link() - "$class" (though valid) was causing
	  errors in at least one PHP IDE due to "class" being a reserved keyword. Changed to 
	  "$cssclass"

2004-03-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b88

	* Change: Gallery now also uses GeekLogs user language.
		  Also Langpacks were adjust to fit.
		  Note: Gallery supports more different Languages then GL,

	* Bug 884488 - Allow owners to hide and unhide their own albums, provided
	  that ownerCanModify or ownerCanDelete is allowed on the parent album.  This
	  also allows users to see their own hidden albums even if they don't own the
	  parent.

	* Bug 837132 - Temporary fix to prevent directory names which weren't submitted
	  with a trailing slash from being dropped completely during the filename

	  if features are enabled without enabling their requirements.

2004-02-26  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b67

	* Bumped album version and added integrityCheck code to rebuild
	  album highlights, since changes to highlight code (1.4.3-cvs-b57)
	  can change the dir/filename where it looks for the highlight and
	  may need to rebuild some to the correct size.

2004-02-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b66

	* New: Added Gallery integration into nsnnuke.

	* Included util.php in GHCC, which is required for the security
	  checks.

	* Fixed a few bugs (including 826586 and 869838) that deal with
	  certain characters needing to be escaped in shell

	  some to use variable variables.  This should fix 843268.

2004-02-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b62

2004-02-24  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b60

	* Bugfix #805443 (75% fix): check hidden items and no-permission
	  subalbums to correctly display album/image count in header of
	  album view and in "album contains:" count in subalbums and at
	  top level.  Count in header of gallery top level still incorrect.

	* More on #598025: regenerate highlight with correct size after

	* Fixed Bug #881690: mod_rewrite couldn't transcribe URLs for albums
	  with a '.' in the name. Prevent creation/rename with '.'  had been

	  cryptographite)

	* Fixed Bug #868522: breadcrumb wasn't rendering properly for nested
	  albums in Offline Mode. Also removed "View full size on/off" buttons

	  work around form autofill issues in some browsers.

	* Bugfix: Users without view comments could still search and find based

2004-02-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b25

2004-02-09  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b24

	   search string.

2004-02-02  Christian Mohn <ch-moh@online.no> 1.4.3-cvs-b20

	* Removed cmd.exe call in platform/fs_win32.php as PHP itself calls
	  this when executing binaries in Win32. 
	  This caused two cmd.exe processes running every time a binary 
	  was called on that platform.

	* Added VBS as a valid executable extension in platform/fs_win32.php
	  VBScript files are valid executables in Windows. :)

	* Changed the temp dir from using the system %temp% variable in
	  fs_win32, to use the Gallery temp dir instead. You may not have
	  allowed PHP access to %TEMP%. This could cause permissions related
	  problems.


2004-02-01  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b19

	* Fixed a bug in save_photos caused by the new tabbed interface.  We
	  were not properly referencing the opener so the progress dialog was
	  not going away after adding photos.

2004-01-30  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b18

	* Fixed several issues in add_photos:
	  - Removed ob_start/ob_end buffering code; if includes are leaking
	    text we want to know about it and fix it.
	  - Got rid of a warning when add_photos_mode cookie isn't set
	  - Fixed warnings in save_photos.php when you submit an empty form
	  - Added window.focus() to add_photos.php so that it doesn't pop under
	  - Fixed Javascript to display progress dialog in upload forms so that
	    they refer to the proper object

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b17
	
	* Change: Skin Update

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b16

	* New: Added Jenskin. A Skin that looks likt the configwizard.

	* Change: Some cosmetic changes.

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b15

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of frame files.
		  and add_photos_frame.php to safetoinclude array.
	
2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b14

	* Added pretty nasty hack to reload the album page in Mini applet
	  mode after upload completes (this relies on add_photos_frame.php
	  and add_photos_refresh.php; if anyone has a better way of
	  executing JavaScript from Java, I'd like to know).

	* Added cookie so that add_photos opens on same tab the user
	  selected last time he used add_photos.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b13

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of includes files.

	* Bugfix: Use function to create URLs.

	* Bugfix: Added missing file.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b12

	* Change: Created lib/Form.php.

	* New: Added "(un)check all" and "invert" selection in config wizard for languages.

	* Change: Added possible for an addon below multiple choices in config wizard.

	* Bugfix: In javascript in the 2nd parameter (name)
		  in window.open are no spaces allowed.
		  NS doesnt care. IE does and result an error when trying to print via Fotokasten.

	* Bugfix: The Radiobutton for Shutterflys Donation is set always.
		  So its saved always as Service.
		  Fix is a workaround.

	* "Bugfix": - Added new css class .adminform.
		    - Set textcolor corresponding in ALL skins.
		    This fixes the "bug" that text was not readable in admin options.	

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b11

	* Move add_photos.php includes into includes/add_photos, per Jens' request

	* Added support in gallery_remote2.php for:
		- getting sub-albums as well as images in fetch-album-images
		- returning the list of root albums in fetch-album-images when
		  invoked with a blank set_albumName
		- getting all albums (including non-writeable) in fetch-albums
	* Made the add_photos menu a CSS-based tab list.

	* Fixed applet invocation in both upload applets.

2004-01-27  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b10

	* Tweaked slideshow applet invocation.

2004-01-27 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b9

	* Bugfix: Missing closing body tag in view_photo.php caused wrong alignment in IE.

	* Change: Removed table line as spacer under searchbox and used css instead.

	* Change: Reworked the display of note when broken albums are found.

	* Change: Renamed and moved fitToWindow in js folder. Added documentation.

	* Bugfix: Fixed Bug introduced in 1.4.2-cvs-b11 (by me).
		  Changed doctype back to be more undetailed.
		  The detailed doctype caused the fitToWindow script not to work when
		  using IE and Gallery was standalone.

2004-01-26  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b8

	* Overhauled the build_manifest script so that it reads the CVS Entries
	  file to find appropriate files to check for version ids.  This way we
	  don't have to maintain a file list (which is error prone).

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b7

	* Bugfix: Changing album permissions who can view comments were broken.

	* Bugfix: When embedded in phpBB2, Permissions for "only logged in" users were broken.
		  Because phpBB2's anonymous user is also logged in. So we have to ignore this.

2004-01-26  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b6

	* Removed Add Photos from the admin menu
	* Changed Add Photo to a tab-based window
	* If GR Applet JARs are present, added two upload tabs: GR Applet Mini and
	  GR Applet
	* Replaced slideshow.php with an Applet-based version. The old slideshow is
	  in slideshow_high.php.
	* The applets are self-signed, you have to trust me in order to run them.
	  This doesn't work on Safari for some reason, so the applet fails on Mac.

	I expect these changes to break some stuff, and I'll be grateful for help
	fixing. Also, plese pipe up with suggestions!

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b5

	* New: Added Martin Smallridge to AUTHORS and give him credits for his phpBB Code.

2004-01-24  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b4

	* Fixed remote security exploit in init.php and setup/init.php where
	  one extract() call can be used to overwrite the input for a
	  subsequent extract() call letting users overwrite GALLERY_BASEDIR

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b3

	* New: added contrib folder with subfolder phpBB2 with documentation
	       and files for phpBB2.

	* New: Added g1-icon.gif

	* Bugfix: When not embedded and mod_rewrite was on, makeGalleryUrl was broken.

	* New: lib folder.

	* Change: extracted all language related functions from util.php
		  into lib/lang.php and include them in util.php.

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b2

	* New: implemented Code for Gallery phpBB2 integration.

	  - Gallery is now ready to be integrated in phpBB2 (2.0.6), but unfortunately
	    you have to modify phpBB2 code and put a new file in your phpBB2 installation.
	    See documentation in the contrib folder.

	  - Detection if we are in phpBB2 ($GALLERY_EMBEDDED_INSIDE_TYPE = 'phpBB2';)

	  - new classes for phpBB2 users.

	  - rewrite of fitToWindow.

2004-01-22  Joan McGalliard  <gallery@joanhenge.plus.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b1

	* This is the beginning of development on v1.4.3.
