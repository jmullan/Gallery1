	/* This file lets you override the default behavior of the Java Applet.
	 * You can create two associative arrays: $configDefaults and $configOverrides
	 * which contain names and values of properties that will be passed to the Java
	 * applets.
	 *
	 * $configDefaults are used to set a default value that may be different
	 * than the value set in the applet's default.properties file.
	 *
	 * $configOverrides are used to force a value, which the user will not be able
	 * to change.
	 *
	 * Normal admins don't need to change anything in this file, but power-admins
	 * may want to customize the variables to specify the behavior of the applets.
	 *
	 * Look for the variable names and default values in the default.properties
	 * file that is inside the GalleryRemoteAppletMini.jar file.
