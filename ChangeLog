2004-05-19  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b129

2004-05-18  Christian Mohn <h0bbel@p0ggel.org>  1.4.4-cvs-b128
	
	* Fix: Changed view_photo.php to show the photoname, and not the index if there
	  is no custom field called Title 

	* Vanity: Added myself to AUTHORS. :)

2004-05-18  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b127

	* Change: Only put metatag with keyword(s) if there we have keyword(s)

2004-05-17  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b125

	* Fix: [View comments] links were disabled even when comments
	  existed in a (sub)album if "Indicate if there are comments
	  available" config option was set to photos and probably off.

	* Change: Pass $gallery->app->comments_indication_verbose as a
	  parameter so some calls to lastCommentDate() can use "no" to see
	  if comments exist.

2004-05-17  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b124

	* Change: Rewrite of getNextPhoto() by Adventure
	  This should be a decent speed optimization, as well as
	  fixing one edge case.  (Though I'm not sure where it was 
	  being missed in the original.) Formatting tweaks and commenting 
	  by me.

2004-05-17  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b123

	* Change: Adjust Layout of upgrade_albums

	  which caused troubled in unsupported charsets.

	* Change: Some translation related changes.

2004-05-16  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b122

	* Fixed a typo since -b112 in captionator.php that was preventing the
	  page from rendering.

2004-05-16  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b121

	* Change: Add watermark preview.  Disable links to watermark
	  album when album is empty. Alignment using X and Y coordinates
	  can use percents.
	* Fix:  Watermark alignment defaults to lower right instead of
	  nothing.  Watermarks incorrectly clipped to the bottom.

2004-05-16  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b120

	* Change: Users in manage_users.php are now sorted.

2004-05-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b117

	* Fix: Actually enable attachOrphans(), since I'd forgotten to pass its
	  variable

2004-05-14  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b116

	* Fix: Double echo in setup/confirm.inc.

	*  Change: Beautification and translateable tools/find_orphans.php

2004-05-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b114

	* Change:  tools/find_orphans.php now uses a form to gather confirmation
	  from the user before performing any changes.  It does not yet support 
	  customized-reattachment.

2004-05-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b113

	* Add:  Initial web-accessible version of find_orphans.php
	  - Does not yet prompt for verification
	  - Orphans are returned to their original parent
	    If the parent is missing they are turned into root albums
	  - Secured so that only admins can access it

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b112

	* Fix: Some counter didnt work, due to wrong use of pluralize_n2

	* Change: Complete replace of pluralize_n with n2

	* Fix: Typo in function galleryDocs

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b111

	  Damaging to albums that contain no images (only sub-albums)

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b110

	* Fix: - Check for ngettext installed
	  - Translation was not correct caught.

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b109

	* Fix: Forgot the "empty" case for the strict photo counting.

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b108

	* New: Introduced first steps of ngettext

	* Fix: reused name="photo_j"

	* Change: return of browserLanguage()

	* New: Additional Paramter for initLanguage()

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b107

	* Change: Add an optional flag to Album::numPhotos() to do strict
	  counting of photos - this prevents albums from being counted as
	  images for the "total" on albums.php

	* Change: Another _SERVER -> HTTP_SERVER_VARS

	* Change: ChangeLog beautification by the compulsive developer

2004-05-12 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b106

	* Fix: Use of $HTTP_SERVER_VARS instead $_SERVER

	* Fix: Parse Error in do_command

2004-05-11  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b105

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in a CMS.
	* Applets now attempt to use the same language as the Gallery (GR language
	  support is sorely lacking at the moment).
	* Integrated applets version 1.4-b10, which also contain many improvements to
	  slideshow and upload. Please see GR ChangeLog for more details.

2004-05-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b104

	* Change: Enable optional syslog reporting for login/out

2004-05-10  Alan Harder <alan.harder@sun.com>  1.4.4-cvs-b103

	* Regenerate highlights as needed when moving albums around.

2004-05-10  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b102

	* Fixed alt="..." attribute in <img> tags to strip out HTML and then
	  convert double quotes to HTML entities. Previously, displaying image
	  captions with HTML or double quotes would output malformed HTML.
	  (Introduced in 1.4.4-cvs-b72 when we added the caption text to the
	  alt attribute.)

2004-05-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b101

	* Change:  Use unhtmlentities() instead of strtr() - this allows
	  us to use html_entity_decode() if it's present

2004-05-07  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b100

	* Change:  Add missing piece of JS for the localGetElementsByTagName()
	  code

2004-05-06  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b99

	* Fix: Links to docs and diagnostics(!) didnt work with empty config.php
	  ($gallery->app->photoAlbumURL is not set)

2004-05-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b98

	* Change: JS shim to make getElementsByTagName() less browser
	  version dependant

2004-05-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b97

	* Change: Config wizard now starts with submit buttons disabled.  They
	  are enabled during document.onload using JavaScript.  This will
	  prevent errors from occuring due to people pressing Next before the page has
	  completed loading, thereby not sending all of the config data to the next page.

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b96

	* Fix: Warning in when recovering password with adding isset to userData.inc.
		Thanks to floridave.

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b95

	  var

	* Change: Extra debug output when using dismissAndLoad() to
	  display $url for troubleshooting.

	* Change: Correct "view_album" to "view_photo" in commentdraw.inc

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b94

	* Fix: Adjust util.php due to renamed config option.
	
	* Change: removed unused/debug code.

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b93

	* New: Added config option for maximum length of comments.

	* Change: Rewrite of navigator.inc and navphoto.inc

	* Fix: Images for Voting Result Graph were not found when embedded.

	* Fix: Removed Bigger border around breadcrumb when not on search page. (Introduced in b81)

	* Changes in setup/frame_test.php:
	  - Corrected use of doctype();
	  - Use of init.php
	  - Use of constant GALLERY_BASE
	  - Use of $HTTP_GET_VARS, because $_GET is only available for PHP >=4.1.0
	  - Use of common_header()

	* Change: Created function drawCommentAddForm which is used inside and in popup 
		  for unified Layout.

	* Change: Moved substitution for array_search when PHP <4.0.5 from
		  view_photo.php into util.php so we can use it everywhere.

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b92

	* Change: Don't use makeGalleryHeaderUrl in do_command "logout"
	  if it's a full url.  (Checking for "^http")

	* Change: Remove extraneous htmlspecialchars() from inline_imagewrap

	* Change: Use doCommand() and add "full" param to popup() in 
	  commentbox.inc and commentdraw.inc to prevent a refresh from
	  occuring, which can cause an issue using the new inline comments.
	  (Post a comment, immediately delete it,  it would attempt to re-post
	  the comment - fixed)

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b91

	* Change: Add an isset() to inline_imagewrap.inc

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b90

	* Change: "width" is not a valid property for <p>

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b89

	* Change:  Remove one more htmlspecialchars() from a location
	  where it might be called twice on one URL

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b88

	* Change: Remove independant htmlspecialchars() calls and move
	  it to a central location in makeGalleryUrl().  The only reason
	  htmlspecialchars() should be called is if make*Url() is not
	  appropriate.

	* Change: Add makeGalleryHeaderUrl() and makeAlbumHeaderUrl()
	  These functions decode the htmlspecialchars() which makeGalleryUrl()
	  calls, since html entities aren't valid in HTTP headers.  It's a
	  somewhat redundant operation, but necessary for code usability.

	* Change: Update all Location: headers to use the make*HeaderUrl()
	  functions.

2004-05-03  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b87

	* Change: Add frame test page that allows the user to preview
	frames before selecting them.

	* Change: inline_imagewrap.inc can now be passed a base directory
	for relative links of the frame images.

	 height="..." was removed for compliant HTML.

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b86

	* Change: Use " " instead of "<wbr>" to break comment lines.
	  (Jens pointed out that wbr isn't valid html.)

	* Fix: Remove extra " from navphoto.inc

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b85

	* Fix: We now make the assumption, when loading the userdb, that
	  the file is user_version 4.  This will ensure that if for some reason
	  (most notably, the userfile format revision from 1.3->1.4)
	  the correct version number is not unserialized from the file, that we
	  will perform the necessary file-format upgrade

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b84

	* Change:  Prevent long comments from creating horizontal scroll
	  by using wordwrap() to add <wbr> tags.

	* Change:  Make 'Popup' be the default comment method.  Changing
	  our default behavior isn't the best option unless the user wants it.

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b83

	* Change: Extra check to determine whether quoting popups is
	  appropriate, since embedded URLs don't use absolute pathing.

2004-05-02 Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b82

	* Change: Disable view_comments when album does not contain any comments.

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b81

	* Fix: Border was not correct around breadcrumb table.

	* Change: HTML and UI beautification and valid HTML in search.php

	* New: Add possibility to add comments without popup, but inside view_photo

	* Change: Beatified appereance of comments.

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b79

	* Change: Moved all voting functions from util.php to lib/voting.php

	* Change: Tweaked view_photo.php

	* Change: Added function displayPhotoFields() so we a unified display.

	* Fix: Wrong filename for validation in extra_fields.php

2004-05-01 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b78

	* Fix: Corrected Typo that causes Poll result not be displayed.
	       (Introduced in 1.4.4-cvs-b66/67)

2004-05-01 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b77

	* New: Added isLoggedIn to phpBB2 Users.

	* Fix: poll_properties was not properly formatting the poll key values
	  in the <input> tags.  Thanks to Asher Choen for finding this.

2004-04-30  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-75
	
	* Change: Use strnatcasecmp instead of strnatcmp in sorting by filename
	  and caption (Tracker #945228)

2004-04-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b74

	* Fix: Missing )

2004-04-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b73

	* Change: Remove unused function parameter from AlbumItem::getPhotoId()
	  and Image::getId() - Thanks to Adventure for finding this

	  http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=16143

2004-04-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b72

	* New: Added extra field for Alttext/title/onMouseover.

	* Change: Added optional paramter to getExtraFields in Album.php.
		  If set to false not all extra Fields are returned.

	* Change: Tweaked getThumbnailTag, getHighlightTag and getPhotoTag to work with alttext.

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b71

	  to fix spelling and uniformity of naming

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b70

	* Change: Correct the identification of the movie.thumb path
	  (get_GalleryPathes() is called in init.php)

2004-04-28  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b69

	* gallery_remote2.php: when an album is set to not allow the user
	  to view full-sized pictures, but there is no resized picture,
	  do allow to view full-sized, because it's the same as resized.
	  This appears to be what the web UI does.

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b68

	* Change: More beatification in resize_photo.php

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b67

	* Change: Forgot some $GALLERY_BASEDIR. Now its complete free.

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b66

		  into <?php common_header(); ?>

	* Change: popup_js, redux. Only quote the string if it contains
	  (^http|^ftp).  JS functions don't like to be quoted.

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b64

	* Change: Properly quote popup_js's return URL and escape quotes
	  which would otherwise break the string early.

2004-04-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b63

	* Change: Move htmlspecialchars() to prevent JS url break
	  ---- REVERTED

2004-04-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b62

	* Change: Rename "ROOT" option in move scripts to ".root" to 
	  prevent interaction with a user album, which could be named
	  "ROOT"
	  - All user-viewable (translatable) text is unchanged; "ROOT"
	    still makes sense, visually.

2004-04-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b61

	* Fix: Adapted move_album issue from b49
	  Until a ".root" album object can be created, move_album needs to
	  not try and check getNestedAlbum against a rooted album.
	  Added isRoot() check prior to getNestedAlbum to bypass.

2004-04-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b60

	* Change: view_album and view_photo are valid, again.
	  (I hadn't tested with rewrite disabled)

2004-04-25 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b59

	* Change: view_album and view_photo are not valid 4.01

	* Change: More use of doctype() and common_header()

	* Fix: Removed warnings in register.php

	* Fix: manage_users, register, user_preferences, delete_user, create_user 
	are now valid HTML 4.01

	* Bugfix: Typo in manage_users.php


2004-04-25 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b58

	* Bugfix: Compatibility in edit_appearance with PHP <4.1.0, but >4.0.4 was broken.

2004-04-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b57

	* Change: Final HTML 4.01 change (for now, at least)
	  Gallery, Album, and Photo all validate as 4.01 Transitional

2004-04-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b56

	* Change: More HTML 4.01-ification
	  - Run htmlspecialchars() on popup_link() and doCommand() output.
	  - Move hidden print photos forms to the end of the page where
	    they're in a valid location.

2004-04-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b55

	* Change: Apply Opera/Safari frames fix to all browsers so that
	  albums.php becomes HTML 4.01 valid.  Updated validation links
	  for Gallery and Slideshow.

2004-04-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b54

	* Change: Change & to &amp; in ml_pulldown.inc
	  This makes album pages validate HTML 4.01, so I updated
	  the validation link.

2004-04-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b53

	* Change: Modify Location: headers to be standards compliant
	  (absoluteURI).  [RFE 939002]

2004-04-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b52

	* Change: Correct if(getAlbumName) checks to if(isAlbum)

	* Change: Remove accidental debug code from b49

2004-04-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b51

	* Fix: changed \" to &quot; in a translateable text.
	       This confuses the substitute function for gettext.

	* Change: HTML fixes.
		-  <img> should not be closed in HTML 4.01
		-  changed all <br /> to <br>

	* Fix: Removed warning in devmode when no watermark dir is set.

	* Fix: Removed empty lines between ?> and <?php in applet.inc.   .
	       This caused warnings when Gallery is embedded and the Applet is installled.

2004-04-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b50

	* Change: Make 'high' the default slideshow mode intead of 'applet'

2004-04-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b49

	* Bugfix: Commented code - This code is not functioning the
	  way it's intended. $gallery->album is referring to the album
	  being moved, not the parent album.  getNestedAlbum returns
	  the number of photos inside the album being moved - 
	  if the index of the album being moved (inside its parent)
	  is larger than the number of photos inside the album being
	  moved, then getAlbumName will return an out of bounds error

2004-04-21  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b48

	* Bugfix: #938293 - Config wizard now says "All tested files up-to-date."
	  when the number of tested files is 0. 

2004-04-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b47

	* Fix: If an album's highlight flag is mistakenly set, but there is no
	  highlight, the album upgrade process fails with PHP errors about deref'ing a

	* Change:  Move the nav_home icon inside the returnTo link, for breadcrumbs.
	  k-man discovered that if galleryTitle isn't set (or is "")
	  it has the same effect as disabling returnTo on single-level
	  albums, since the anchor is displayed empty.

2004-03-03  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b90

	* Added new Spiral Notebook frame.  Thanks to carlandtracey.com;

	  and check for uninitialized variables as well.

	* Bug 851148: Fix 'unknown' error which occurs when using left/right navigation
	  in an album with hidden photos.  This removes albums from the navigation entirely,
	  since it doesn't make sense for them to be in there.

	  before we tried to resize/highlight them.

	* Other:  Check for variable initialization in edit_thumb.php

	* Other:  Redirect not-logged-in users to albums.php if they attempt to navigate
	  to upgrade_albums.php.  Previously, a blank page was displayed.

	* Other:  Variable name change in popup_link() - "$class" (though valid) was causing
	  errors in at least one PHP IDE due to "class" being a reserved keyword. Changed to 
	  "$cssclass"

2004-03-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b88

	* Change: Gallery now also uses GeekLogs user language.
		  Also Langpacks were adjust to fit.
		  Note: Gallery supports more different Languages then GL,

	* Bug 884488 - Allow owners to hide and unhide their own albums, provided
	  that ownerCanModify or ownerCanDelete is allowed on the parent album.  This
	  also allows users to see their own hidden albums even if they don't own the
	  parent.

	* Bug 837132 - Temporary fix to prevent directory names which weren't submitted
	  with a trailing slash from being dropped completely during the filename

	  if features are enabled without enabling their requirements.

	  referenced without having been set first.

2004-02-26  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b67

	* Bumped album version and added integrityCheck code to rebuild
	  album highlights, since changes to highlight code (1.4.3-cvs-b57)
	  can change the dir/filename where it looks for the highlight and
	  may need to rebuild some to the correct size.

2004-02-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b66

	* New: Added Gallery integration into nsnnuke.

	* Included util.php in GHCC, which is required for the security

	  certain characters needing to be escaped in shell

	  some to use variable variables.  This should fix 843268.

2004-02-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b62

	  are physically part of the gallery directory. (Bug #903168)

2004-02-24  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b60

	* Bugfix #805443 (75% fix): check hidden items and no-permission
	  subalbums to correctly display album/image count in header of
	  album view and in "album contains:" count in subalbums and at
	  top level.  Count in header of gallery top level still incorrect.

	* More on #598025: regenerate highlight with correct size after

	* Fixed Bug #881690: mod_rewrite couldn't transcribe URLs for albums
	  with a '.' in the name. Prevent creation/rename with '.'  had been

	  integrityCheck() convert any existing albums with the '.' (fix by
	  cryptographite)

	* Fixed Bug #868522: breadcrumb wasn't rendering properly for nested
	  albums in Offline Mode. Also removed "View full size on/off" buttons

	  work around form autofill issues in some browsers.

	  fs_win32, to use the Gallery temp dir instead. You may not have
	  allowed PHP access to %TEMP%. This could cause permissions related
	  problems.


2004-02-01  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b19

	* Fixed a bug in save_photos caused by the new tabbed interface.  We
	  were not properly referencing the opener so the progress dialog was
	  not going away after adding photos.

2004-01-30  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b18

	* Fixed several issues in add_photos:
	  - Removed ob_start/ob_end buffering code; if includes are leaking
	    text we want to know about it and fix it.
	  - Got rid of a warning when add_photos_mode cookie isn't set
	  - Fixed warnings in save_photos.php when you submit an empty form
	  - Added window.focus() to add_photos.php so that it doesn't pop under
	  - Fixed Javascript to display progress dialog in upload forms so that
	    they refer to the proper object

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b17
	
	* Change: Skin Update

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b16

	* New: Added Jenskin. A Skin that looks likt the configwizard.

	* Change: Some cosmetic changes.

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b15

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of frame files.
		  and add_photos_frame.php to safetoinclude array.
	
2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b14

	* Added pretty nasty hack to reload the album page in Mini applet
	  mode after upload completes (this relies on add_photos_frame.php
	  and add_photos_refresh.php; if anyone has a better way of
	  executing JavaScript from Java, I'd like to know).

	* Added cookie so that add_photos opens on same tab the user
	  selected last time he used add_photos.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b13

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of includes files.

	* Bugfix: Use function to create URLs.

	* Bugfix: Added missing file.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b12

	* Change: Created lib/Form.php.

	* New: Added "(un)check all" and "invert" selection in config wizard for languages.

	* Change: Added possible for an addon below multiple choices in config wizard.

	* Bugfix: In javascript in the 2nd parameter (name)
		  in window.open are no spaces allowed.
		  NS doesnt care. IE does and result an error when trying to print via Fotokasten.

	* Bugfix: The Radiobutton for Shutterflys Donation is set always.
		  So its saved always as Service.
		  Fix is a workaround.

	* "Bugfix": - Added new css class .adminform.
		    - Set textcolor corresponding in ALL skins.
		    This fixes the "bug" that text was not readable in admin options.	

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b11

	* Move add_photos.php includes into includes/add_photos, per Jens' request

	* Added support in gallery_remote2.php for:
		- getting sub-albums as well as images in fetch-album-images
		- returning the list of root albums in fetch-album-images when
		  invoked with a blank set_albumName
		- getting all albums (including non-writeable) in fetch-albums
	* Made the add_photos menu a CSS-based tab list.

	* Fixed applet invocation in both upload applets.

2004-01-27  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b10

	* Tweaked slideshow applet invocation.

2004-01-27 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b9

	* Bugfix: Missing closing body tag in view_photo.php caused wrong alignment in IE.

	* Change: Removed table line as spacer under searchbox and used css instead.

	* Change: Reworked the display of note when broken albums are found.

	* Change: Renamed and moved fitToWindow in js folder. Added documentation.

	* Bugfix: Fixed Bug introduced in 1.4.2-cvs-b11 (by me).
		  Changed doctype back to be more undetailed.
		  The detailed doctype caused the fitToWindow script not to work when
		  using IE and Gallery was standalone.

2004-01-26  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b8

	* Overhauled the build_manifest script so that it reads the CVS Entries
	  file to find appropriate files to check for version ids.  This way we
	  don't have to maintain a file list (which is error prone).

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b7

	* Bugfix: Changing album permissions who can view comments were broken.

	* Bugfix: When embedded in phpBB2, Permissions for "only logged in" users were broken.
		  Because phpBB2's anonymous user is also logged in. So we have to ignore this.

2004-01-26  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b6

	* Removed Add Photos from the admin menu
	* Changed Add Photo to a tab-based window
	* If GR Applet JARs are present, added two upload tabs: GR Applet Mini and
	  GR Applet
	* Replaced slideshow.php with an Applet-based version. The old slideshow is
	  in slideshow_high.php.
	* The applets are self-signed, you have to trust me in order to run them.
	  This doesn't work on Safari for some reason, so the applet fails on Mac.

	I expect these changes to break some stuff, and I'll be grateful for help
	fixing. Also, plese pipe up with suggestions!

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b5

	* New: Added Martin Smallridge to AUTHORS and give him credits for his phpBB Code.

2004-01-24  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b4

	* Fixed remote security exploit in init.php and setup/init.php where
	  one extract() call can be used to overwrite the input for a
	  subsequent extract() call letting users overwrite GALLERY_BASEDIR

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b3

	* New: added contrib folder with subfolder phpBB2 with documentation
	       and files for phpBB2.

	* New: Added g1-icon.gif

	* Bugfix: When not embedded and mod_rewrite was on, makeGalleryUrl was broken.

	* New: lib folder.

	* Change: extracted all language related functions from util.php
		  into lib/lang.php and include them in util.php.

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b2

	* New: implemented Code for Gallery phpBB2 integration.

	  - Gallery is now ready to be integrated in phpBB2 (2.0.6), but unfortunately
	    you have to modify phpBB2 code and put a new file in your phpBB2 installation.
	    See documentation in the contrib folder.

	  - Detection if we are in phpBB2 ($GALLERY_EMBEDDED_INSIDE_TYPE = 'phpBB2';)

	  - new classes for phpBB2 users.

	  - rewrite of fitToWindow.

2004-01-22  Joan McGalliard  <gallery@joanhenge.plus.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b1

	* This is the beginning of development on v1.4.3.
