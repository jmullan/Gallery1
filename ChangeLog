	* Fix: In Linux, PHP with gettext and only system locales installed
	       that maybe fit (en_US.utf8 or de_DE.ISOwhatever) 
	       config reported that no suitable locales where found.

	* Change: Enhancements for locale aliases. Empty values are allowed and will be removed from config.
		  ***** This needs testing !! *****

2004-06-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b226

	* Change: view_album - variable name conflict

	* Change: index - Kludge for postnuke .75 (RC3) - they're no longer
	  exporting GET variables (ala register_globals), which is better
	  security, but broke our 'include' variable.

2004-06-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b225

	* Change: view_album optimization for large albums by Mark Curly from
	  gallery-devel.  I've tested this, but it will need a real good look
	  during code freeze and RC.

2004-06-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b224

	* Change: Update the check.inc messages to reflect the 'php_value' 
	  error correctly, instead of saying that it's a mod_rewrite error.

2004-06-27  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b223

	* Fix: Mambo (Form) Photo-Upload was broken, because we loaded the popup without be called
	       through Mambo. So Mambo-Information were lost.
	       Infos are now stored in session when calling makeGalleryUrl with option popup.
	       Those infos are erased when Gallery is loaded "normal" the next time.

	* Fix: Gallery didnt recognized logout from Mambo.

	* New: Add Text in configwizard to remind user to switch off Debug Mode

2004-06-26  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b222

	* Change: Don't have gallery_mail() print out the email even when
	  we're in debug mode.  This can cause unintended security issues.

2004-06-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b221

	* Change:  Dumbest bug evar!  Don't re-initialize $albumDB on every call
	  to a recursive-calling function.  It's slower than you can possibly imagine.

2004-06-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b220

	* Change:  "!isset($page)" to "empty($page)"
	  http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=81113#81113

2004-06-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b219

	  on it.  Check...

2004-06-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b216

	* Add: Random Block - added and updated to use our save serialization
	  functions

	* Change: album->canReadRecurse() - change "global $albumDB" to a new
	  albumDB, since not all callers have established an albumDB.

2004-06-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b215

	* Change: Suppress non-essential ini_set() error message, if server disallows
	  ini_set()

	* Change: Only execute start_session() if we're not embedded.
	  When embedded, this throws an "already started" error message with devMode on.

	* Fix: Bug #978297; User-Language was not saved for selfregisterd users.

2004-06-22  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b211

	* Fixed typo in upload (and slideshow) applets for Geeklog.

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b210

	* Change: config wiz - try and find a closer match to the requested
	  language for locale aliases.  If we don't find a really close match,
	  fall back to a semi-close one.  (Check for "en_US" before falling back to
	  "en", etc.)

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b209

	* Bug 977777: If newName and oldName are the same, just close the
	  dialog

2004-06-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b208

	  we don't need to! (Probably more of these coming.)

2004-06-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b204

	* Change: Add wordwrapping for comments as a failsafe, in case of
	  pre-1.4.4 abusive comments.

	* Change: Modify text for comments_length in config wiz to note that
	  we have a hard limit of 1000 chars.

2004-06-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b203

	* Fix: Prevent abnormally large comments from being entered.
	  New limits:  100 chars for name, 1000 chars for comment

2004-06-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b202

	* Change: Performance enhancement for getNextPhoto() - we don't need
	  to load the photos for subalbums when we're checking permissions,
	  we only need the album itself.  Cuts our getFile() calls in half.

2004-06-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b201

	* Fix: Out of Bounds error in postnuke

	* Change:  Add "\r\n" to a mail() additional header, just in case.
	  (It shouldn't be needed, since it's the only header)

	* Change: Add option to set default album permissions to 
	  "loggedin" instead of "everybody"

2004-06-18  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b199

2004-06-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b195

	* Fix: Change the global "$sessionVar" to something which won't confuse
	  the config wizard and create a $gallery->app->sessionVar string
	  which gets longer on each re-configuration.

	* Change: Correct the session cookie names in add_photos and slideshow so that
	  they have the underscore before their name.  "gallery_sessionaddphotos_mode"
	  was kind of unappealing to look at.

2004-06-15 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b194

	* New: Added outOfDateAlbums to AlbumDB. 
	       It contains the names of all Albums that are out of Date.

		  instead add a bigger warning on mainpage.

2004-06-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b193

	* Change: PHP 5 changes, small optimization, additional security checks

2004-06-15 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b192

	* Change: Album Property Border-width from "off" to 0
	  - increased album and config version

	* Change: indention in
	  - html_wrap/slideshow.header.default
	  - layout/navtablebegin.inc
	  - layout/navtablemiddle.inc
	  - layout/navtableend.inc

	* Fix: Border was not always correct in layout/breadcrumb.inc

2004-06-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b191

	* Change:  strcmp() to strcasecmp() due to PHP5 behavior of retaining
	  capitalization returned from un/serialize()

	* Change:  Add a '10' option to "rows" in config wizard to match
	  the album properties page.  (Bug 970087)

2004-06-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b189

	* Change: Add set_time_limit() to init.php to cover situations
	  where we don't explicitly reset the timer.  If the user increases
	  the default timer, it will cover all of Gallery, not just the specific
	  points that we call it for.  By calling set_time_limit() for specific
	  processes, we just reset the timer so that things can take longer.

2004-06-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b188

	* Change: Minor optimization in Album->setHighlight()

	* Change: Extra checking in AlbumItem->setHighlight() to 
	  try and prevent issues with movies.  Upgrade/Movie error is
	  still unreproduceable.

2004-06-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b187

	* New: Added Config option to allow everybody to see the comment overview, not only admins.

2004-06-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b186

	  Mozilla not refreshing the album after upload in embedded environs.

2004-06-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b185

		http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20031222.html # 10

2004-06-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b184

	* Add:  Re-add secure.sh and configure.sh ... should never
	  have removed them in the first place - they'll be necessary/nice
	  for upgrades.  Also for security-minded people who want to chmod
	  config.php and .htaccess to unwriteable states.  Modified secure.sh
	  to not chmod 0 setup, and to remove setup/resetadmin if it's present.

2004-06-09 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b183

	* New: Add Link to Config Wizard for logged in Admins on Startpage

	* Change:  Add an 'uploadMode' option to config wizard to define which
	  method to default to for add_photos.

	* Fix:  Make sure that the user_version is set correctly for new users and for
	  the userdb to prevent the 'upgrading users' notice on a new install.

2004-06-08 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b181

	* Fix: Javascript for next/prev Tabs was not correct initialisized.
	  (Caught by Christian M.)

2004-06-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b177

	* Change: Text updates to config wizard, cause wizard to forget Guid
	  if the resetadmin file is removed after it's set, remove bad require()

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b176

	* Change: Enable session-based GUID checking for "resetadmin" as
	  suggested by bharat

	* Change: Re-ran manifest to get rid of the recently removed files,
	  and as a general version update.

2004-06-03 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b175
	
	* Change: Tweaked again setup/login.inc

	* Change: Wording for messages when unconfigured or reconfiure is needed

	* Change: Removed unused files from error/

2004-06-02 Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b174

	* Fix: Bug#962076, add "watermark" to "admin options" drop down menu.

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b173

	* Fix: Config wizard - Using a valid admin account would log you 
	  in, even with a bad password.

2004-06-03 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b172

	* Change: Removed Caption for Custom Fields

	* Change: Layout of setup/login.inc

	* Fix: login.inc didnt recognized a new login after logout from Gallery 
	

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b171

	* Change: functionalize login requirement to configLogin() in
	  functions.inc with a single parameter of "basename(__FILE__)"
	  so that it can tell which file it's posting back to.

	* Change: Add session support to setup/init.php so that the admin
	  only has to log in once, instead of once for each php module.

	* Change: Add authorization requirement to all setup/* modules
	  (excluding frame_test, since there's no real reason)

	* Change: Removed configure.bat/sh and secure.bat/sh from manifest.inc
	  (I don't think this matters?  They'd be removed on the manifest rebuild
	  anyway, right?)

2004-06-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b170

	* Change: Tweaked publish_XP Docs

	* Fix: Removed Warning in search when Gallery is embedded

2004-06-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b169

	  is bypassed

	* Change: Remove the permissions check from gallerySanityCheck()

	* Change: Remove configure.(bat|sh) and secure.(bat|sh)

	* Change:  Add user security to config wizard (!!)
	  If a Gallery has been configured, require the user to login as
	  an admin before allowing them to reconfigure using the config wizard.
	  Users configuring for the first time are allowed to bypass the login
	  requirement.

	  Still needed:  A method to reset the administrator password if it's lost.

2004-06-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b167

	* New: Enable mod_rewrite for GeekLog

2004-06-01  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-165

	* Fix: Major security issue with init.php, which allowed anybody
	  to login as any user (including admin) with no password, by 
	  emulating that Gallery was embedded.

2004-06-01  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b164

	* Change: Clear up some PHP_NOTICEs in the config wizard

	  a static one to save time and make debugging easier.

2004-05-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b163

	* Change: Move guid generation explicitly to album creation, and
	  photo add/delete to save processing time.

	* Change: Correct photo count on albums.php to not include albums

2004-06-01  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b162

	* Fix: Bug #959948.
	  Thanks to "darkunderdog".

2004-05-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b161

	* Change: Text spacing change in albums.php

	* Change: Extra check in canReadRecursive() to deal with a weird
	  issue that h0bbel found with an orphan.

2004-05-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b160

	* Change: GUID needs to be added to new albums on creation, otherwise
	  the RSS is generated with a blank guid field (if no photos have been
	  added to the new album)

2004-05-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b159

	* Bug 921262:  Add -trim to jpegtran rotation options to prevent
	  artifacting when images don't match the "normal" dimensions

	* Bug 852395:  If the user navigates to a new album while editing 
	  captions, throw an error and abort changes.  This *could* be adapted
	  to just load the correct album, however if they've navigated, we
	  don't know if they have modified that album or not.

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b158

	* Change: Better detection of which pubDate to use for RSS feeds

	* Change: Implement canReadRecurse() in search.php - you now
	  cannot search for any album which you can not directly link to
	  from an albums page.

	* Change: Flag 'autoRotated' after manual rotation to prevent this:
	  Use has autorotate disabled.  Uploads a photo.  Manually rotates
	  it to proper orientation.  Later enables autorotate.  Moves photo.
	  ... if autoRotate isn't flagged, the move will cause autorotate to
	  rotate it, even though it was done manually.

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b157

	* Change: Text fix for RSS option in config_data

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b156

	* Change: Add "canReadRecurse" to Album - use canReadRecurse in RSS feed
	  to optimize the "albumFindable" call that was in the original RSS.php

	* Change: Fix casing on getAlbumByName.  More occurances were using the 
	  upper-cased "by" than not, so this is an official correction

2004-05-28  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b155

	* Fix: Removed warning in Config Wizard, when no config.php is there.

2004-05-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b154

	* Change: Add field "guid" to Album which is used by RSS to
	  determine if an item is new.  The guid is updated with each
	  photo upload.

	* Change: Add extraField "autoRotated" to AlbumItem
	  This field is checked to determine if we have already rotated
	  an item before so that we don't do it again on an item move.

	* Change: album_version was revved to 29 for both of these changes

2004-05-27  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b153

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in Geeklog.

2004-05-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b152

	* Fix:  Correct URL to rss.php when in embedded mode.  We can't
	  use makeGalleryUrl() since that links to an embedded rss.php
	  which really isn't usable.

	* Change:  Remove an unnecessary if block from rss.php

2004-05-27  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b151

	* Change: Add watermark on upload support, form and URL upload only.

	* Fix: Do not set recursive, unless displaying form.  Attempts to
	  fix bug #958542, watermarking: exclude subalbums not working.
	  (Thanks to primedomain) 

2004-05-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b150

	* Fix: rss.php now correctly retrieves highlights which are set
	  in a sub-album, rather than the target album itself.

2004-05-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b149

	* Fix: Remove border=1 from gallery.footer, added in last checkin

	* Fix: Correct linebreaks in config_data.inc

2004-05-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b148

	* Change: Complete Config Wizard-ization of rss.php

	* Change: Addition of RSS link to the bottom of the gallery.footer
	  if rss is enabled.

2004-05-26  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b147

	* Fix: Remove warnings in rss.php when in dev mode an not reconfigured.

	* Change: Little text change.

2004-05-25  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b146

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in PHPNuke.
	  Other CMSs may need more work. The applets are confirmed to work
	  with PHPNuke and PostNuke.

2004-05-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b145

	* Change: rss.php config options mostly migrated to config wizard.

2004-05-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b144

	* Change:  Add "php_value session.save_handler files" to 
	  the php_values.template to proactively prevent some of the 
	  cases where it's set to "user" system-wide.

	* Change: Add a developer-file hook to init.php.  If the file
	  "lib/devel.php" is present on your local system, it will be 
	  included near the top of init.php.  It's a logical location for
	  code profiling modules and such that shouldn't be checked into
	  CVS, but you don't want getting overwritten with each cvs up.

2004-05-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b143

	* Change: Only display visible (non-hidden) albums

	* Change: Fix PHP shorttags

	* Change: Text changes

	* Note: Lots of whitespace changes - use "diff -w -r1.1 -r1.2"
	  to see the real changes

2004-05-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b142

	* Add:  Initial version of Cody Smith's RSS Generator
	  Based on rss.php 0.4 - Migration to config.php variables next

2004-05-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b141

	* Change:  Accidentally committed debug code in init.php - removing

2004-05-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b140

	* Change: Use makeGalleryHeaderUrl() instead of makeGalleryUrl() in
	  makeFormIntro due to the fact that we, later in the function, split
	  parameters based on "&"

2004-05-23  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b139

	* Change:
	  !!  2004-05-23:   adv_search.php has been broken
	  !!  for an unknown amount of time.  Since it has
	  !!  no references from outside files, it will 
	  !!  automatically redirect to albums.php until
	  !!  it can be fixed

2004-05-23  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b138

	* Change: Items which are children of hidden parents can not be located
	  using search.php.  I extensively debugged and profiled this to ensure that
	  it is being called as few times as possible.  Recursion is only called on 
	  matching objects.

2004-05-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b137

	* Change: Create watermark preview files with an incrementing number.
	  This prevent an issue where the preview doesn't reload after modification
	  due to smart browser caching.

	  This change required addition of a generic glob() function for PHP < 4.3.0
	  so that the old preview files can be removed when creating a new one, or
	  when finalizing the watermark. (PHP >= 4.3 uses the native glob())

2004-05-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b136

	* Change: Watermarking code was missing some quotes around "checked"
	  in several locations

2004-05-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b135

	* Change: A couple "&nbsp" => "&nbsp;" text fixes

	* 957300: Prevent two different-format images from being uploaded
	  with the same basename.  (i.e.  hello.jpg and hello.gif don't both
	  end up being tagged as "hello")

2004-05-21  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b134

	* Change: Revert part of b129. Only Album title is now a link.

	* Fix: Removed warning in view_photo

	* Change: show "no Caption" in view_photo, if photo has no caption

	* Fix: removed default class in function showChoice in view_album, 
	       due to unreadable pulldown menu in some skins.

2004-05-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b133

	* Change: Add a check to available_skins() to fix URLs when 
	  photoAlbumURL isn't set yet

	* Change: Un-hide devMode in the Technical section of the
	  config wizard, with a warning for non-PHP-savvy users

	* Change: Fix typo in config wizard text

2004-05-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b132

	* Change: Revert xhtml

2004-05-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b131

	* Change: docType() now returns XHTML 1.0 Transitional

	* Change: Beginning of translation to XHTML 1.0 Transitional
	  albums.php validates, when albumTree is turned off

2004-05-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b130

	* Change: Add missing text to phpBB2 manual-howto

	* Change: Descriptive text for find_orphans

2004-05-19  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b129

	* New: Album title, photo and movie captions are now links in view_album.

2004-05-18  Christian Mohn <h0bbel@p0ggel.org>  1.4.4-cvs-b128
	
	* Fix: Changed view_photo.php to show the photoname, and not the index if there
	  is no custom field called Title 

	* Vanity: Added myself to AUTHORS. :)

2004-05-18  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b127

	* Fix: Use of htmlentities(unhtmlentities()) for Alttext of photos

2004-05-18  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b126

	* Fix: Added missing global $gallery in function itemLastCommentDate($i)

	* New: Applied idea of Patch #869056

	* New: Added possibility to have additional Attributes for the link on photos.

	* Change: removed unused(?) code in view_photo ($openAnchor)

	* Fix: Use of unhtmlentities() for Alttext of photos

	* Change: Only put metatag with keyword(s) if there we have keyword(s)

2004-05-17  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b125

	* Fix: [View comments] links were disabled even when comments
	  existed in a (sub)album if "Indicate if there are comments
	  available" config option was set to photos and probably off.

	* Change: Pass $gallery->app->comments_indication_verbose as a
	  parameter so some calls to lastCommentDate() can use "no" to see
	  if comments exist.

2004-05-17  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b124

	* Change: Rewrite of getNextPhoto() by Adventure
	  This should be a decent speed optimization, as well as
	  fixing one edge case.  (Though I'm not sure where it was 
	  being missed in the original.) Formatting tweaks and commenting 
	  by me.

2004-05-17  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b123

	* Change: Adjust Layout of upgrade_albums

	* Fix: Removed unneeded htmlentity stuff in edit_appearance.php 
	  which caused troubled in unsupported charsets.

	* Change: Some translation related changes.

2004-05-16  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b122

	* Fixed a typo since -b112 in captionator.php that was preventing the
	  page from rendering.

2004-05-16  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b121

	* Change: Add watermark preview.  Disable links to watermark
	  album when album is empty. Alignment using X and Y coordinates
	  can use percents.
	* Fix:  Watermark alignment defaults to lower right instead of
	  nothing.  Watermarks incorrectly clipped to the bottom.

2004-05-16  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b120

	* Change: Users in manage_users.php are now sorted.

2004-05-15  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b119

	* Change: Add recursive watermark of albums.

2004-05-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b118

	* Change: Better missing parent detection, minor text changes

2004-05-14  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b117

	* Fix: Actually enable attachOrphans(), since I'd forgotten to pass its
	  variable

2004-05-14  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b116

	* Fix: Double echo in setup/confirm.inc.
	  Thanks to Terje.

2004-05-14  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b115

	*  Change: Beautification and translateable tools/find_orphans.php

2004-05-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b114

	* Change:  tools/find_orphans.php now uses a form to gather confirmation
	  from the user before performing any changes.  It does not yet support 
	  customized-reattachment.

2004-05-13  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b113

	* Add:  Initial web-accessible version of find_orphans.php
	  - Does not yet prompt for verification
	  - Orphans are returned to their original parent
	    If the parent is missing they are turned into root albums
	  - Secured so that only admins can access it

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b112

	* Fix: Some counter didnt work, due to wrong use of pluralize_n2

	* Change: Complete replace of pluralize_n with n2

	* Fix: Typo in function galleryDocs

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b111

	* Fix: Don't use strict numPhotos where it was being used!
	  Damaging to albums that contain no images (only sub-albums)

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b110

	* Fix: - Check for ngettext installed
	  - Translation was not correct caught.

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b109

	* Fix: Forgot the "empty" case for the strict photo counting.

2004-05-13 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b108

	* New: Introduced first steps of ngettext

	* Fix: reused name="photo_j"

	* Change: return of browserLanguage()

	* New: Additional Paramter for initLanguage()

2004-05-12  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b107

	* Change: Add an optional flag to Album::numPhotos() to do strict
	  counting of photos - this prevents albums from being counted as
	  images for the "total" on albums.php

	* Change: Another _SERVER -> HTTP_SERVER_VARS

	* Change: ChangeLog beautification by the compulsive developer

2004-05-12 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b106

	* Fix: Use of $HTTP_SERVER_VARS instead $_SERVER

	* Fix: Parse Error in do_command

2004-05-11  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b105

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in a CMS.
	* Applets now attempt to use the same language as the Gallery (GR language
	  support is sorely lacking at the moment).
	* Integrated applets version 1.4-b10, which also contain many improvements to
	  slideshow and upload. Please see GR ChangeLog for more details.

2004-05-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b104

	* Change: Enable optional syslog reporting for login/out

2004-05-10  Alan Harder <alan.harder@sun.com>  1.4.4-cvs-b103

	* Regenerate highlights as needed when moving albums around.

2004-05-10  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.4-cvs-b102

	* Fixed alt="..." attribute in <img> tags to strip out HTML and then
	  convert double quotes to HTML entities. Previously, displaying image
	  captions with HTML or double quotes would output malformed HTML.
	  (Introduced in 1.4.4-cvs-b72 when we added the caption text to the
	  alt attribute.)

2004-05-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b101

	* Change:  Use unhtmlentities() instead of strtr() - this allows
	  us to use html_entity_decode() if it's present

2004-05-07  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b100

	* Change:  Add missing piece of JS for the localGetElementsByTagName()
	  code

2004-05-06  Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.4-cvs-b99

	* Fix: Links to docs and diagnostics(!) didnt work with empty config.php
	  ($gallery->app->photoAlbumURL is not set)

2004-05-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b98

	* Change: JS shim to make getElementsByTagName() less browser
	  version dependant

2004-05-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b97

	* Change: Config wizard now starts with submit buttons disabled.  They
	  are enabled during document.onload using JavaScript.  This will
	  prevent errors from occuring due to people pressing Next before the page has
	  completed loading, thereby not sending all of the config data to the next page.

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b96

	* Fix: Warning in when recovering password with adding isset to userData.inc.
		Thanks to floridave.

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b95

	* Change: Allow doCommand("delete-comment") to use the $return
	  var

	* Change: Extra debug output when using dismissAndLoad() to
	  display $url for troubleshooting.

	* Change: Correct "view_album" to "view_photo" in commentdraw.inc

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b94

	* Fix: Adjust util.php due to renamed config option.
	
	* Change: removed unused/debug code.

2004-05-04 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b93

	* New: Added config option for maximum length of comments.

	* Change: Rewrite of navigator.inc and navphoto.inc

	* Fix: Images for Voting Result Graph were not found when embedded.

	* Fix: Removed Bigger border around breadcrumb when not on search page. (Introduced in b81)

	* Changes in setup/frame_test.php:
	  - Corrected use of doctype();
	  - Use of init.php
	  - Use of constant GALLERY_BASE
	  - Use of $HTTP_GET_VARS, because $_GET is only available for PHP >=4.1.0
	  - Use of common_header()

	* Change: Created function drawCommentAddForm which is used inside and in popup 
		  for unified Layout.

	* Change: Moved substitution for array_search when PHP <4.0.5 from
		  view_photo.php into util.php so we can use it everywhere.

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b92

	* Change: Don't use makeGalleryHeaderUrl in do_command "logout"
	  if it's a full url.  (Checking for "^http")

	* Change: Remove extraneous htmlspecialchars() from inline_imagewrap

	* Change: Use doCommand() and add "full" param to popup() in 
	  commentbox.inc and commentdraw.inc to prevent a refresh from
	  occuring, which can cause an issue using the new inline comments.
	  (Post a comment, immediately delete it,  it would attempt to re-post
	  the comment - fixed)

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b91

	* Change: Add an isset() to inline_imagewrap.inc

2004-05-04  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b90

	* Change: "width" is not a valid property for <p>

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b89

	* Change:  Remove one more htmlspecialchars() from a location
	  where it might be called twice on one URL

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b88

	* Change: Remove independant htmlspecialchars() calls and move
	  it to a central location in makeGalleryUrl().  The only reason
	  htmlspecialchars() should be called is if make*Url() is not
	  appropriate.

	* Change: Add makeGalleryHeaderUrl() and makeAlbumHeaderUrl()
	  These functions decode the htmlspecialchars() which makeGalleryUrl()
	  calls, since html entities aren't valid in HTTP headers.  It's a
	  somewhat redundant operation, but necessary for code usability.

	* Change: Update all Location: headers to use the make*HeaderUrl()
	  functions.

2004-05-03  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b87

	* Change: Add frame test page that allows the user to preview
	frames before selecting them.

	* Change: inline_imagewrap.inc can now be passed a base directory
	for relative links of the frame images.

	* Fix: Added style="height:<?php echo $hRR ?>px" to frames,
	 height="..." was removed for compliant HTML.

2004-05-03  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b86

	* Change: Use " " instead of "<wbr>" to break comment lines.
	  (Jens pointed out that wbr isn't valid html.)

	* Fix: Remove extra " from navphoto.inc

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b85

	* Fix: We now make the assumption, when loading the userdb, that
	  the file is user_version 4.  This will ensure that if for some reason
	  (most notably, the userfile format revision from 1.3->1.4)
	  the correct version number is not unserialized from the file, that we
	  will perform the necessary file-format upgrade

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b84

	* Change:  Prevent long comments from creating horizontal scroll
	  by using wordwrap() to add <wbr> tags.

	* Change:  Make 'Popup' be the default comment method.  Changing
	  our default behavior isn't the best option unless the user wants it.

2004-05-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b83

	* Change: Extra check to determine whether quoting popups is
	  appropriate, since embedded URLs don't use absolute pathing.

2004-05-02 Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b82

	* Change: Disable view_comments when album does not contain any comments.

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b81

	* Fix: Border was not correct around breadcrumb table.

	* Change: HTML and UI beautification and valid HTML in search.php

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b80

	* New: Add possibility to add comments without popup, but inside view_photo

	* Change: Beatified appereance of comments.

2004-05-02 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b79

	* Change: Moved all voting functions from util.php to lib/voting.php

	* Change: Tweaked view_photo.php

	* Change: Added function displayPhotoFields() so we a unified display.

	* Fix: Wrong filename for validation in extra_fields.php

2004-05-01 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b78

	* Fix: Corrected Typo that causes Poll result not be displayed.
	       (Introduced in 1.4.4-cvs-b66/67)

2004-05-01 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b77

	  in the <input> tags.  Thanks to Asher Choen for finding this.

2004-04-30  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.4-cvs-75
	
	* Change: Use strnatcasecmp instead of strnatcmp in sorting by filename
	  and caption (Tracker #945228)

2004-04-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b74

	* Fix: Missing )

2004-04-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b73

	* Change: Remove unused function parameter from AlbumItem::getPhotoId()
	  and Image::getId() - Thanks to Adventure for finding this

	  http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=16143

2004-04-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b72

	* Change: Tweaked getThumbnailTag, getHighlightTag and getPhotoTag to work with alttext.

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b71

	* Change: Renamed get_GalleryPathes() to getGalleryPaths() 
	  to fix spelling and uniformity of naming

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b70

	* Change: Correct the identification of the movie.thumb path
	  (get_GalleryPathes() is called in init.php)

2004-04-28  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b69

	* gallery_remote2.php: when an album is set to not allow the user
	  to view full-sized pictures, but there is no resized picture,
	  do allow to view full-sized, because it's the same as resized.
	  This appears to be what the web UI does.

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b68

	* Change: More beatification in resize_photo.php

2004-04-28 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.4-cvs-b67

	  (^http|^ftp).  JS functions don't like to be quoted.

2004-04-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.4-cvs-b64

	* Fix: Adapted move_album issue from b49
	  Until a ".root" album object can be created, move_album needs to

	* Fix: Removed warning in devmode when no watermark dir is set.

	  way it's intended. $gallery->album is referring to the album
	  being moved, not the parent album.  getNestedAlbum returns
	  the number of photos inside the album being moved - 
	  if the index of the album being moved (inside its parent)
	  is larger than the number of photos inside the album being
	  moved, then getAlbumName will return an out of bounds error

2004-04-21  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.4-cvs-b48

	* Fix: If an album's highlight flag is mistakenly set, but there is no
	  highlight, the album upgrade process fails with PHP errors about deref'ing a

	  (specifically it now works with the MS Java VM that comes with

	  before we tried to resize/highlight them.

	* Other:  Check for variable initialization in edit_thumb.php

	* Other:  Redirect not-logged-in users to albums.php if they attempt to navigate
	  to upgrade_albums.php.  Previously, a blank page was displayed.

	* Other:  Variable name change in popup_link() - "$class" (though valid) was causing

	  "$cssclass"

	* Change: Gallery now also uses GeekLogs user language.

	* Bug 884488 - Allow owners to hide and unhide their own albums, provided

	  parent.

	  with a trailing slash from being dropped completely during the filename

2004-02-26  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b67

	* Bumped album version and added integrityCheck code to rebuild
	  album highlights, since changes to highlight code (1.4.3-cvs-b57)
	  can change the dir/filename where it looks for the highlight and
	  may need to rebuild some to the correct size.

2004-02-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b66

	* New: Added Gallery integration into nsnnuke.

	  certain characters needing to be escaped in shell

2004-02-24  Alan Harder  <alan.harder@sun.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b60

	* Bugfix #805443 (75% fix): check hidden items and no-permission
	  subalbums to correctly display album/image count in header of
	  album view and in "album contains:" count in subalbums and at
	  top level.  Count in header of gallery top level still incorrect.

	* More on #598025: regenerate highlight with correct size after

	* Fixed Bug #881690: mod_rewrite couldn't transcribe URLs for albums

	  cryptographite)

	* Fixed Bug #868522: breadcrumb wasn't rendering properly for nested

	  work around form autofill issues in some browsers.

2004-02-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b25

	  - Added New Section in Step2 to set embedded type and Geeklog Path
	  - Added GeekLog classes so that Galley uses their users.

2004-02-09  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b24

	* Bugfix: Made a Workaround for strange Environments with 
	  Magic Quotes On and no or ignored .htaccess files.

	   search string.

2004-02-02  Christian Mohn <ch-moh@online.no> 1.4.3-cvs-b20

	* Removed cmd.exe call in platform/fs_win32.php as PHP itself calls
	  this when executing binaries in Win32. 
	  This caused two cmd.exe processes running every time a binary 
	  was called on that platform.

	* Added VBS as a valid executable extension in platform/fs_win32.php
	  VBScript files are valid executables in Windows. :)

	* Changed the temp dir from using the system %temp% variable in
	  fs_win32, to use the Gallery temp dir instead. You may not have
	  allowed PHP access to %TEMP%. This could cause permissions related
	  problems.


2004-02-01  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b19

	* Fixed a bug in save_photos caused by the new tabbed interface.  We
	  were not properly referencing the opener so the progress dialog was
	  not going away after adding photos.

2004-01-30  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b18

	* Fixed several issues in add_photos:
	  - Removed ob_start/ob_end buffering code; if includes are leaking
	    text we want to know about it and fix it.
	  - Got rid of a warning when add_photos_mode cookie isn't set
	  - Fixed warnings in save_photos.php when you submit an empty form
	  - Added window.focus() to add_photos.php so that it doesn't pop under
	  - Fixed Javascript to display progress dialog in upload forms so that
	    they refer to the proper object

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b17
	
	* Change: Skin Update

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b16

	* New: Added Jenskin. A Skin that looks likt the configwizard.

	* Change: Some cosmetic changes.

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b15

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of frame files.
		  and add_photos_frame.php to safetoinclude array.
	
2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b14

	* Added pretty nasty hack to reload the album page in Mini applet
	  mode after upload completes (this relies on add_photos_frame.php
	  and add_photos_refresh.php; if anyone has a better way of
	  executing JavaScript from Java, I'd like to know).

	* Added cookie so that add_photos opens on same tab the user
	  selected last time he used add_photos.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b13

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of includes files.

	* Bugfix: Use function to create URLs.

	* Bugfix: Added missing file.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b12

	* Change: Created lib/Form.php.

	* New: Added "(un)check all" and "invert" selection in config wizard for languages.

	* Change: Added possible for an addon below multiple choices in config wizard.

	* Bugfix: In javascript in the 2nd parameter (name)
		  in window.open are no spaces allowed.
		  NS doesnt care. IE does and result an error when trying to print via Fotokasten.

	* Bugfix: The Radiobutton for Shutterflys Donation is set always.
		  So its saved always as Service.
		  Fix is a workaround.

	* "Bugfix": - Added new css class .adminform.
		    - Set textcolor corresponding in ALL skins.
		    This fixes the "bug" that text was not readable in admin options.	

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b11

	* Move add_photos.php includes into includes/add_photos, per Jens' request

	* Added support in gallery_remote2.php for:
		- getting sub-albums as well as images in fetch-album-images
		- returning the list of root albums in fetch-album-images when
		  invoked with a blank set_albumName
		- getting all albums (including non-writeable) in fetch-albums
	* Made the add_photos menu a CSS-based tab list.

	* Fixed applet invocation in both upload applets.

2004-01-27  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b10

	* Tweaked slideshow applet invocation.

2004-01-27 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b9

	* Bugfix: Missing closing body tag in view_photo.php caused wrong alignment in IE.

	* Change: Removed table line as spacer under searchbox and used css instead.

	* Change: Reworked the display of note when broken albums are found.

	* Change: Renamed and moved fitToWindow in js folder. Added documentation.

	* Bugfix: Fixed Bug introduced in 1.4.2-cvs-b11 (by me).
		  Changed doctype back to be more undetailed.
		  The detailed doctype caused the fitToWindow script not to work when
		  using IE and Gallery was standalone.

2004-01-26  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b8

	* Overhauled the build_manifest script so that it reads the CVS Entries
	  file to find appropriate files to check for version ids.  This way we
	  don't have to maintain a file list (which is error prone).

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b7

	* Bugfix: Changing album permissions who can view comments were broken.

	* Bugfix: When embedded in phpBB2, Permissions for "only logged in" users were broken.
		  Because phpBB2's anonymous user is also logged in. So we have to ignore this.

2004-01-26  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b6

	* Removed Add Photos from the admin menu
	* Changed Add Photo to a tab-based window
	* If GR Applet JARs are present, added two upload tabs: GR Applet Mini and
	  GR Applet
	* Replaced slideshow.php with an Applet-based version. The old slideshow is
	  in slideshow_high.php.
	* The applets are self-signed, you have to trust me in order to run them.
	  This doesn't work on Safari for some reason, so the applet fails on Mac.

	I expect these changes to break some stuff, and I'll be grateful for help
	fixing. Also, plese pipe up with suggestions!

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b5

	* New: Added Martin Smallridge to AUTHORS and give him credits for his phpBB Code.

2004-01-24  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b4

	* Fixed remote security exploit in init.php and setup/init.php where
	  one extract() call can be used to overwrite the input for a
	  subsequent extract() call letting users overwrite GALLERY_BASEDIR

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b3

	* New: added contrib folder with subfolder phpBB2 with documentation
	       and files for phpBB2.

	* New: Added g1-icon.gif

	* Bugfix: When not embedded and mod_rewrite was on, makeGalleryUrl was broken.

	* New: lib folder.

	* Change: extracted all language related functions from util.php
		  into lib/lang.php and include them in util.php.

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b2

	* New: implemented Code for Gallery phpBB2 integration.

	  - Gallery is now ready to be integrated in phpBB2 (2.0.6), but unfortunately
	    you have to modify phpBB2 code and put a new file in your phpBB2 installation.
	    See documentation in the contrib folder.

	  - Detection if we are in phpBB2 ($GALLERY_EMBEDDED_INSIDE_TYPE = 'phpBB2';)

	  - new classes for phpBB2 users.

	  - rewrite of fitToWindow.

2004-01-22  Joan McGalliard  <gallery@joanhenge.plus.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b1

	* This is the beginning of development on v1.4.3.
