2004-08-24  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b126

	* Fix:  Long filename / disclosure fix

	* Fix:  Sorting by caption ignored albums, because they have no "caption"
	  It now sorts them by their titles.

	* Change: Add getGUID() to prevent code repetition

2004-08-20  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b125

	* Change:  different div tags in login.php as well as centered text 
		boxes.  This is a temporary fix until the full review of
		ideas for CSS is finished.

2004-08-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b124

	* Change:  Minor wording changes

2004-08-19  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b123

	* GR protocol: now returning the max image size for albums in addition
	  to the intermediate size.
	* gallery_remote2.php: removed output buffering.

2004-08-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b122

        * Fix: Make doubly-sure that we're setting mambo session vars when
          embedded, to prevent the 'No info' error.

2004-08-19  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b121

	* Fix: Typos.

2004-08-18  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b120

	* Change: Extra whitespace in despam-comments

	* Fix: Missing echo in save_photos

	* Change: Prevent non-admin users from changing their own usernames via user
	  preferences

	* Change: Use & refs in get*Vars to save a miniscule amount of memory

2004-08-18  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b119

	* Fix: Added a setup option for "slowPhotoCount".  The accurate photo count
	  on the Gallery index page was a much requested change, however it proved to
	  be so slow on some machines/Galleries that this will disable it unless
	  explicitly enabled by the user during setup.  (Galleries with vast numbers
	  of albums or images could take as long as 30 seconds to load the index, by
	  user reports)

2004-08-17  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b118

	* Fix: Variable ordering bug in user_preferences

2004-08-17  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b117

        * Fix: Navigation bar width was dependant on whether images were resized or not...
          this caused albums where resize_size was off to have the table width set to 0.

        * Fix: Extra-long filename prevention in save_photos.php, as well as verifying
          that the uploaded file is a valid image format before saving to the temp
          directory

2004-08-16  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b116

	* Fix: Enable slideshow in albums containing only sub-albums when
	  slideshow_recursive is yes.

2004-08-17  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b115

	* Change: Code cleanups in util.php

	* Fix: Moved return out of if clause in getFilesVar() and getEnvVar()

2004-08-17  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b114

	* Fix: Added missing ) in classes/Album.php

2004-08-16  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b113

        * Fix: If 'shutterfly' is set, but not checked, unset it during the
          album upgrade.  This caused shutterfly to appear even though it wasn't
          really enabled.

2004-08-16  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b112

	* Fix: bharat's cache code - Use getRequestVar() instead of 
	  HTTP_GET_VARS and move the return inside the fopen, so that 
	  if it fails for any reason we don't return a blank page

2004-08-16  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>  1.4.5-cvs-b111

	* Modified block-random.php to put the part that retrieves a 
	  photo into a function so that sites can easily modify it to
	  generate 2 random photos (like we do on gallery.menalto.com)

	* Fixed tools/despam-comments.php to work properly inside 
	  Postnuke (and hopefully all other CMSen)

2004-08-16  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>  1.4.5-cvs-b110

        * Added a tool for finding and removing comment spam from your 
          gallery.  You can import and maintain your own blacklist.
          It's very inefficient, but it works.

2004-08-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b109

	* Change: Corrected Userfile check again - checking is_writeable()
	  by itself wasn't sufficient.

2004-08-15  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b108

	* Fix: The 'Userfile not writeable' error completely broke new installs where
	  the userfile doesn't exist yet.

2004-08-15  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b107

	* Fix: Remove Debug Code.

2004-08-15  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b106

	* Change: Use timestamp for itemCaptureDate. This required a album version bump.

	* New: Possibility to use capture date as caption.

2004-08-13  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b105

	Change: Initial commit of a little Block for Caption Options during upload.

	Fix: strftime uses different format then date (for captions)

2004-08-11  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b104

	* Change:  Porting a missed fix forward - 
	  phpBB2/modules.php needs to extract variables even when register_globals
	  is enabled.

2004-08-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b103

	* Change: Support the new-style phpnuke embedding (no 'modload' passed)

	* Change: Correct the sample phpnuke random block

2004-08-10  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b102

	* Add: block-Random_Image.php.sample for phpnuke

	* Change: Added gpl.txt to phpBB2/modules.php

2004-08-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b101

        * Fix: Print fatal error message instead of obscure PHP error
          when userDB fails to init before we try and use it.

	* Change: Print the correct graphics package path in check_imagemagick.php

2004-08-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b100

	* Change: Add 'properties' link to the main page for 
	  each root album

	* Change: Make 'apply to subalbums' text clickable

	* Change: check isset() on request vars in index.php

2004-08-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b98

	* Change: Make several files ready for register_globals
	  photo_owner
	  search
	  user_preferences
	  index

2004-08-09  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b97

        * Fix: numAccessibleItems was incorrectly checking isHiddenRecurse()
          for albums.  It needed to just be isHidden()

2004-08-08  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b96

	* New: Delete of multiple users.
	
	* Changed: Added possibility to transport an array via makeGalleryUrl

	* Change: Comment out a button disabling due to JS error.
	  Note: This needs to be fixed correctly !

2004-08-06  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b95

        * Fix: Prevent foreach() error from being displayed when previewing
          watermark previews.

        * Fix: Logging into Gallery as a non-admin and then trying to reset
          the admin password failed.  The logged in user was used and the
          resetadmin file was ignored

2004-08-05  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b94

	* Change: Only call srand() once, instead of once at each rand()
	  location.

2004-08-05  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b93

	* Fix: Quote URLs in  block-random for better HTML compliance
 
2004-08-05  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b92

	* Fix: Adjust Subject changes also to SMTP method.

2004-08-05  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b91

	* Fix: Use unhtmlentities for subject and msg in gallery_email()

	* Fix: Add header for content charset in gallery_email()

2004-08-04  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b90

	* Change: When user wants photo captions to be filedate,
	  then now the format from config is used.

2004-08-03  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b89

	* Fix: Bug #1002883  Albums could be renamed to include a 
		% character in the name which is interpreted as 
		an escape character and causes all kinds of issues

2004-08-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b88

        * Fix: Extract _FILES in phpBB2's modules.php

        * Change: Remove modules.php.gz, add modules.php so that we can track
          code changes.  There's no real reason for it to be gzip'ed.
          - Updated HowTo.txt and removed 'unzip'...

2004-08-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b87

	* Fix: multi_create was b0rked

2004-08-02  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b86

	* Change:  Modify all popups to have the same CSS tags so that
		they will look more uniform and look better with skins.

	* Fix: misc. html cleanup including removing center tags and
		replacing with align="center"

2004-08-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b85

	* Fix: Correct logic in _getStyleSheetLinks 

2004-08-02  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b84

	* Change: Added "Return to Gallery" link to find_orphans.php

2004-08-02  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b83

	* Fixed phpBB2 integration (I'd missed the big superglobals change before).
	* Fixed version number (b82 didn't bump).

2004-08-02  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b82

        * Fix: Correct the check_exec function which was being a little too liberal
          in its regex for exec.  (shell_exec was incorrectly labeled as 'exec')

        * Fix: Don't display clickable dimensions for movies

        * Fix: Stack the custom fields on top of each other - users were
          really displeased by the side-by-side view

        * Fix: The admin options on root albums were displaying inside the
          Mambo UI.

2004-07-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b81

	* Change: Make edit_appearance compatible with register_globals being
	  turned off.

	* Change: Make sessions compatible with no-register_globals

2004-07-31  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b80

        * Change: edit_appearance needs to properly handle the empty variable
          without issuing any PHP notices/warnings
          (Thanks for finding the issue, Tim)

2004-07-31  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-79

	 * Fix: Disabling ALL print services in edit_appearance (album properties) did not work.

2004-07-31  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-78

        * Fix: Removed shorttags in classes/phpbb files

2004-07-30  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b77

        * Fix: The admin options on root albums were displaying inside the
          Mambo UI.

2004-07-29  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b76

	* Fix: view_comments would display albums without read permissions
	  (user could not see anything except highlight image and album title)

	* Change: Prevent the old 'example' geeklog_dir from causing a 
	  security violation

2004-07-29  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b75

	* Fix: Typo in config data.

2004-07-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b74

	* Change: Switch from rand() to mt_rand() because it's faster,
	  and more random.  Also, add mt_srand() in places where we
	  were missing srand() originally.

2004-07-28  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b73

	* Fix: Typo in register.php prevented user registration

	* Change: Unset the old invalid geeklog_dir during confirm

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b72

	* Change: Completely eliminate the "embedded_inside_type" variable,
	  since *everything* is auto-detected anyway and it really wasn't used.  
	  GeekLog still requires one variable, but it was already dealt with as
	  needed.

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b71

        * Fix: Prevent the random block from grabbing an album highlight as its
          image.

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b70

        * Fix: Mambo popups failed to operate because the option var wasn't
          set on systems with register_globals disabled - how did this
          ever work?

        * Fix: Eliminate two shutterfly/print_photos notices in edit_appearance

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b69

        * Fix: I believe that this should fix the issue that some users have
          had with extremely large Gallery installations during the upgrade
          script, where the albums just don't show up on the page at all.

2004-07-27  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b68

        * Fix: Display the 'view comments in nested album' links for all users
          in commentboxtop.inc.  This was restricted to admin/owner only, so it
          broke navigation when view comments was allowed for all users.

        * Change: Fix uninitialized variable notice

2004-07-26  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b67

        * Fix: Trim trailing spaces from setup vars where no-trailing-slash is
          set.  This prevents the "/usr/bin /pnmtojpeg" issue

        * Fix: The addition of the 'view comments' for everyone was exposing
          hidden photos since view_comments.php had been written with only
          the owner/admin in mind.

2004-07-25  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b66

	* Change: Remove bastard newlines from delete_user and delete_album that were causing
	  jscript errors in Firefox.

2004-07-25  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b65

	* Fix: In some strange permission sets we got non fitting error messages.
	  - When upload_tmp_dir is not in open_basedir
	  - When userdir and /or files in it are is not writeable.

2004-07-24  Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de>  1.4.5-cvs-b64

        * Fix: Redirect in multi_create_user didnt worked after successfull adding.
               Reason: doctype header was set before redirect header.

2004-07-23  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b63

	* Fix: Skins will be ignored when embedded.  This was causing a lot
	  of display issues for users due to skin colors conflicting with
	  embedding-system colors.

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b62

        * Fix?: Revert an earlier checkin (b100?) that prevented a PHP notice
          when first loading sessions while embedded.  Some users report not
          getting a session at all in postnuke.  Since postnuke was the original
          problem, I'm confused, but this will work.  Supressing the notice using
          @session_start()

2004-07-22  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.5-cvs-b61

	* html_wrap/inline_imagewrap.inc: Removed showstopping typo

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b60

        * Change: Remove the != SUNOS line from lib/lang.php
          We're under the assumption that it was added based on a bogus
          bug report some time ago because all docs (and user reports)
          claim that the LANG= line is necessary.

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b59

	* Fix: Missing ]

2004-07-22 Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.5-cvs-b58

	* Fix: Show Album Summary only if it exists.

	* Fix: wrong html around Album Summary.

	* Fix: Correct .vassummary class for all skins.

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b57

	* Change: Better handling of the onsubmit/double-clicking issue
	  utilizing an 'action' input which is changed depending on
	  which button was clicked.

2004-07-22 Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.5-cvs-b56

	* Change: Print Extra fields above comments in view_photo

	* New: Added css for album summary

	* Change: Print Album summary above voting results and button

	* Change: Cleanup and fixed irritating error messages in login

2004-07-22  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b55

	* Fix: Unset variable prevention

	* Fix: b0rked list() in last checkin

2004-07-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b54

	* Change: Partial de-globalization of config wizard.

2004-07-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b53

	* Change: 'No files' to 'All files', and remove a stray binary
	  char.

2004-07-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b52

	* Change: Whitespace readability changes

	* Change: Prevent unset variable notices from PHP

2004-07-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b51

	* Change: Prevent unset variable notices from PHP

2004-07-21  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b50

	* Change:  Simplify the output for the confirm page of the 
	  config wizard.  This allows us to use only one output buffer,
	  requiring less memory, and chance for error.

	  Errors are now placed inline with the normal config.php data,
	  and prepended with //, just like the "optional" lines.

2004-07-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b49

	* Change: getRequestVar, getEnvVar, getFilesVar now accept string arrays

	* Change: Correct the default value for the new SMTP option

2004-07-21  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b48

	* Change: show "highlight" under images when logged in as an admin
		if the image is a highlight

2004-07-20  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b47

	* Merged in changes made to 1.4.4 branch, except for what ckdake
	  already merged (thanks ckdake).
	* Fixed applets when Gallery is embedded in phpBB2.

2004-07-20  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b46
                                                                                                    
        * Change: Users can specificy a mail server to use other than
		one running on the local machine.

2004-07-20  Chris Kelly <ckdake@users.sf.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b45

	* Change: When editing captions, provide a popup for each image to 
		show the sized image

2004-07-20  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.5-cvs-b44

	* Fix: hidden albums are now indicated as such in fetch-album-images
	  (GR protocol)

2004-07-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b43

	* Change: Add 'alternate' link to the header if RSS is enabled

2004-07-20  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b42

	* Change: Check for fitToWindow before outputting the 'onclick'
	  attribute in view_photo.

2004-07-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b41

	* Change: Unglobalize login.php

2004-07-19  Jay Rossiter <cryptographite@users.sf.net>  1.4.5-cvs-b40

	* Change: Since we no longer do shutterfly donations, 
	  $gallery->app->default["print_photos"] can end up being ""
	  which causes the key() in view_photo to fail.  This prevents
	  the error message from key() and prevents printing of a blank
	  print href.

2004-07-19 JoEllen Drazan <skins@pownuke.com> 1.4.5-cvs-b39

	* Change: New variable to pull the thumsize to create a 
		  defaultwidth and height for the divCell to align everything up.

2004-07-19 Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.5-cvs-b38

	* Change: Added link to JoEllen Drazans Skin Page in ConfigWizard.

2004-07-18 Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.5-cvs-b37

	* Change: Accidently reverted 1.4.5-cvs-b12 rereverted ;)

2004-07-18 Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de> ; JoEllen Drazan <skins@pownuke.com> 1.4.5-cvs-b36
	
	* Fix: Added css classes to have "old" layout.

	* New: Added version number and Last Update to Skins.

2004-07-18 Jens A. Tkotz <jens@peino.de> ; JoEllen Drazan <skins@pownuke.com> 1.4.5-cvs-b35
