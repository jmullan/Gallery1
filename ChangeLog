	* Added feedback to the user when resizing all thumbnails or all
	  photos. 

	* Lots of small changes regarding thumbnails not worth mentioning
	  here. 

	* Fixed a bug where resizing to original size was not working at all.

	* Removed gif_support feature because now NetPBM is mandatory.

	* resize now uses the netpbm library to do resize instead of
	  GD. This rUleZ. [CHRIS]

	* Made the border size a choice so that off could be an
	  option. Also made the resize a choice, for the same reason [CHRIS]

	* When loading the old values, it was looking at
	  app->defaults[xxx] instead of app->default[xxx], so the defaults
	  was always getting reset to the original settings.  [CHRIS]

	* Fixed several bugs stemmming from the fact that we were not
	  always correctly treating all thumbnails as JPGs.  This would
	  mean that we'd sometimes leave cruft files lying around which
	  would prevent deleting albums.

	* Added new setup process using the 'setup' directory.  This
	set of pages, although not yet very robust, will walk you through
	the process of configuring Gallery for your local site.
