	* Rotating photos now also rotates the resized version (instead of
	  throwing it out).

	* Removed an extra backslash from htaccess.template that was
	  causing the mod_rewrite rules generated in .htaccess to be
	  broken.  This caused us not to be able to view album photos.

	* Removed final dependencies on GD and JPEG, so likewise removed
	  those checks from the config wizard

	* Setup code: Made the code that detects the webserver uid more
	  robust so that it'll work in the absence of posix (it falls back
	  on 'whoami')

	* Setup code: Removed extra commas at the end of array
	  initializers as they caused parse problems on earlier versions
	  of PHP 4  

2000-09-19  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Added error checking code to allow us to catch photos that we
	  won't be able to work with and flag them early.  This helps us
	  prevent having extra crufty file lying around the album from
	  failed photo insertions (which in turn leads to problems when we
	  want to delete the album)
	  
	* Abstracted my ad-hoc flush code into a function and put it in
	  util.php

	* Broke classes.php up into individual class files.  I should have
	  done this ages ago...the repetition of method names across
	  classes makes it hard to find the right method if they're all in
	  the same file.

2000-09-17  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Added versioning support

	* Added feedback to the user when resizing all thumbnails or all
	  photos. 

	* Lots of small changes regarding thumbnails not worth mentioning
	  here. 

	* Fixed a bug where resizing to original size was not working at all.

	* Removed gif_support feature because now NetPBM is mandatory.

	* resize now uses the netpbm library to do resize instead of
	  GD. This rUleZ. [CHRIS]

	* Made the border size a choice so that off could be an
	  option. Also made the resize a choice, for the same reason [CHRIS]

	* When loading the old values, it was looking at
	  app->defaults[xxx] instead of app->default[xxx], so the defaults
	  was always getting reset to the original settings.  [CHRIS]

	* Fixed several bugs stemmming from the fact that we were not
	  always correctly treating all thumbnails as JPGs.  This would
	  mean that we'd sometimes leave cruft files lying around which
	  would prevent deleting albums.

2000-07-05  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Added new setup process using the 'setup' directory.  This
	set of pages, although not yet very robust, will walk you through
	the process of configuring Gallery for your local site.

2000-07-04  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Updated README to reflect v1.0 feature list
