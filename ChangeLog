        * Changed wrong image height in navphoto.inc

	  cryptographite)

	* Fixed Bug #885369: search.php is now disabled for non-admins if the

	  cryptographite)

2004-02-18  Andrew Lindeman <joyoflinux@yahoo.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b40

2004-02-10  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b29

	  applet, high or low version. Also better homogeneity between high and
	  low versions.
	* Introduced a cookie that keeps the user's preference for which slideshow
	  to use.
	* Added support in the slideshow applet for honoring settings for number
	  of images, randomness and recursiveness.

2004-02-11 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b28

	  opening up a remote exploit

2004-02-10 Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b26

2004-02-10 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b25

	  - Added New Section in Step2 to set embedded type and Geeklog Path
	  - Added GeekLog classes so that Galley uses their users.

2004-02-09  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b24

	* Fixed a bug in gallery_remote2.php which caused all directories
	  to be returned to GR under some circumstances.

2004-02-06 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b23

	* Change: Next try to get my jenskin into cvs.

2004-02-02  Beckett Madden-Woods  <beckett@beckettmw.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b22

2004-02-02  Don Willingham <donwillingham@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b21

	*  Allows admins to search comments by IP address, by adding IP to the
	   search string.

2004-02-02  Christian Mohn <ch-moh@online.no> 1.4.3-cvs-b20

        * Removed cmd.exe call in platform/fs_win32.php as PHP itself calls
          this when executing binaries in Win32. 
          This caused two cmd.exe processes running every time a binary 
          was called on that platform.
        
        * Added VBS as a valid executable extension in platform/fs_win32.php
          VBScript files are valid executables in Windows. :)

        * Changed the temp dir from using the system %temp% variable in
          fs_win32, to use the Gallery temp dir instead. You may not have
          allowed PHP access to %TEMP%. This could cause permissions related
          problems.


2004-02-01  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b19

	* Fixed a bug in save_photos caused by the new tabbed interface.  We
	  were not properly referencing the opener so the progress dialog was
	  not going away after adding photos.

2004-01-30  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b18

	* Fixed several issues in add_photos:
	  - Removed ob_start/ob_end buffering code; if includes are leaking
	    text we want to know about it and fix it.
	  - Got rid of a warning when add_photos_mode cookie isn't set
	  - Fixed warnings in save_photos.php when you submit an empty form
	  - Added window.focus() to add_photos.php so that it doesn't pop under
	  - Fixed Javascript to display progress dialog in upload forms so that
	    they refer to the proper object

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b17
	
	* Change: Skin Update

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b16

	* New: Added Jenskin. A Skin that looks likt the configwizard.

	* Change: Some cosmetic changes.

2004-01-30 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b15

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of frame files.
		  and add_photos_frame.php to safetoinclude array.
	
2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b14

	* Added pretty nasty hack to reload the album page in Mini applet
	  mode after upload completes (this relies on add_photos_frame.php
	  and add_photos_refresh.php; if anyone has a better way of
	  executing JavaScript from Java, I'd like to know).

	* Added cookie so that add_photos opens on same tab the user
	  selected last time he used add_photos.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b13

	* Bugfix: Added GALLERY_BASEDIR for inclusion of includes files.

	* Bugfix: Use function to create URLs.

	* Bugfix: Added missing file.

2004-01-29 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b12

	* Change: Created lib/Form.php.

	* New: Added "(un)check all" and "invert" selection in config wizard for languages.

	* Change: Added possible for an addon below multiple choices in config wizard.

	* Bugfix: In javascript in the 2nd parameter (name)
		  in window.open are no spaces allowed.
		  NS doesnt care. IE does and result an error when trying to print via Fotokasten.

	* Bugfix: The Radiobutton for Shutterflys Donation is set always.
		  So its saved always as Service.
		  Fix is a workaround.

	* "Bugfix": - Added new css class .adminform.
		    - Set textcolor corresponding in ALL skins.
		    This fixes the "bug" that text was not readable in admin options.	

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b11

	* Move add_photos.php includes into includes/add_photos, per Jens' request

	* Added support in gallery_remote2.php for:
		- getting sub-albums as well as images in fetch-album-images
		- returning the list of root albums in fetch-album-images when
		  invoked with a blank set_albumName
		- getting all albums (including non-writeable) in fetch-albums
	* Made the add_photos menu a CSS-based tab list.

	* Fixed applet invocation in both upload applets.

2004-01-27  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b10

	* Tweaked slideshow applet invocation.

2004-01-27 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b9

	* Bugfix: Missing closing body tag in view_photo.php caused wrong alignment in IE.

	* Change: Removed table line as spacer under searchbox and used css instead.

	* Change: Reworked the display of note when broken albums are found.

	* Change: Renamed and moved fitToWindow in js folder. Added documentation.

	* Bugfix: Fixed Bug introduced in 1.4.2-cvs-b11 (by me).
                  Changed doctype back to be more undetailed.
                  The detailed doctype caused the fitToWindow script not to work when
                  using IE and Gallery was standalone.

2004-01-26  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b8

	* Overhauled the build_manifest script so that it reads the CVS Entries
	  file to find appropriate files to check for version ids.  This way we
	  don't have to maintain a file list (which is error prone).

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b7

	* Bugfix: Changing album permissions who can view comments were broken.

	* Bugfix: When embedded in phpBB2, Permissions for "only logged in" users were broken.
		  Because phpBB2's anonymous user is also logged in. So we have to ignore this.

2004-01-26  Pierre-Luc Paour  <paour@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.3-cvs-b6

	* Removed Add Photos from the admin menu
	* Changed Add Photo to a tab-based window
	* If GR Applet JARs are present, added two upload tabs: GR Applet Mini and
	  GR Applet
	* Replaced slideshow.php with an Applet-based version. The old slideshow is
	  in slideshow_high.php.
	* The applets are self-signed, you have to trust me in order to run them.
	  This doesn't work on Safari for some reason, so the applet fails on Mac.

	I expect these changes to break some stuff, and I'll be grateful for help
	fixing. Also, plese pipe up with suggestions!

2004-01-26 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b5

	* New: Added Martin Smallridge to AUTHORS and give him credits for his phpBB Code.

2004-01-24  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b4

	* Fixed remote security exploit in init.php and setup/init.php where
	  one extract() call can be used to overwrite the input for a
	  subsequent extract() call letting users overwrite GALLERY_BASEDIR

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b3

	* New: added contrib folder with subfolder phpBB2 with documentation
	       and files for phpBB2.

	* New: Added g1-icon.gif

	* Bugfix: When not embedded and mod_rewrite was on, makeGalleryUrl was broken.

	* New: lib folder.

	* Change: extracted all language related functions from util.php
		  into lib/lang.php and include them in util.php.

2004-01-23 Jens Tkotz <jens@peino.de> 1.4.3-cvs-b2

	* New: implemented Code for Gallery phpBB2 integration.

	  - Gallery is now ready to be integrated in phpBB2 (2.0.6), but unfortunately
	    you have to modify phpBB2 code and put a new file in your phpBB2 installation.
	    See documentation in the contrib folder.

	  - Detection if we are in phpBB2 ($GALLERY_EMBEDDED_INSIDE_TYPE = 'phpBB2';)

	  - new classes for phpBB2 users.

	  - rewrite of fitToWindow.

2004-01-22  Joan McGalliard  <gallery@joanhenge.plus.com> 1.4.3-cvs-b1

	* This is the beginning of development on v1.4.3.
