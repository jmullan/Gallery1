 * SECURITY FIX *

  It was possible to use/"inject" Javascript inside various places
  to abuse this as a XSS Exploit.

  Now every userinput got from $_REQUEST is sanitized.
  We use the PEAR packages HTML_Safe and XML_HTMLSax3 to do this.
  Nice benefit is that HTML is now again possible in captions, titles, etc.

  The Team would like to thank Aditya Mooley for catching and reporting this.
  And giving us the time to fix it before going to public.

  Aditya Mooley is member of the Coppermine-Gallery Development team.
  So have a look at http://coppermine.sf.net,
  the page of our friendly competittion application.
