	* Fixed bug in the setup code that generates the anytopnm wrapper.
	  It was not basing the wrapper on the path the user provided --
	  it was only basing it on the path that it found.  This will
	  further help non-FreeBSD users.

	* Changed from using constant() to one_constant() in setup code
	  'cause "constant" is now a reserved word in PHP 4.0.4

	* Backticks (`) are no longer valid as part of an album name/url

	* Added last modification date and the number of items in the
	  album to the album description.

        * Moved 'Edit Album Title' to the Album Properties Popup.
        
        * Added app parameter galleryTitle. Because of this bumped the
          version number.

        * Created a style sheet for the gallery. It can be overriden
          by a custom style sheet. It controls fonts and colors. 
          Album parameters override these styles when appropriate.

        * Created a new directory called html_wrap. It contains 
          wrapper html for the three page types in the gallery:
            gallery main, album view and photo view.
          These wrappers can be used to customize the look of the
          three page types. If custom wrappers are not provided, 
          the default ones are used.
          All gallery html is now encapsulated within the navigation
          bars on these pages (a nice rectangle).

        * Added an 'admin' box to sit over the navigation bars. It
          contains the admin controls.

        * All popups now use the gallery style sheet and when 
          appropriate have a default focus. 

2001-01-02  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@sinia.com>

	* Made the NetPBM check optional since now it doesn't need to be
	  in the path and you can specify it by hand during the config process.

	* Fixed a conflict between PHP magic quotes and my new anytopnm
	  wrapper by disabling magic quotes in the gallery app.

2001-01-01  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com>

	* Made New Year's resolution to enter my changes in the changelog.

	* Added fancy frames to the photos in AlbumView and PhotoView. 
	  These frames can be configured on a per-Album basis (in the 
          'Edit Album Appearence' panel.

	* UI revamp if the navigation controls (used in the main page and
	  AlbumView pages). Fancy icons.

	* Added navigation controls to the ViewPhoto Page. More fancy icons.

	* Added 'breadcrumb' control to ViewAlbum and ViewPhoto pages. Even
	  more fancy icons.  

	* Revamped the admin photo controls. You guessed it, fancy icons.

2001-01-01  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@sinia.com>

	* Switched from using system("mv") to using rename() for greater
	  portability (thanks Andreas Fuchs [fox@tcnet.ch])

	* Added a wrapper around anytopnm so that it will work properly on
	  webservers that don't have the NetPBM binary directory in the
	  path.  This should ease the pain on most standard Linux
	  configurations. 

2000-12-29  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@sinia.com>

	* Fixed several small bugs involving uploading movies.  

	* We now include the error details when an error occurs adding a
	  photo or movie to an album.

	* Minor page navigator cleanup

	* Fixed the config wizard to request the movie thumbnail image as
	  a filesystem path instead of a URL (since we copy it into the
	  album instead of linking to it)

	* Added config version numbering.  During the Gallery upgrade
	  process, this will alert you if it's necessary to re-run the
	  configuration wizard.

	* the generated config.php now contains the GPL license

	* Config wizard now locates the 'mv' binary and uses it via it's
	  full path to avoid a weird bug where the webserver looks for it
	  in /

2000-12-28  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@harmony.menalto.com>

	* Fixed bug #126982; the wizard won't save config.php if you don't
	  provide zip binaries (and everything else -- ie, it had no
	  concept of an optional constant).

2000-12-27  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@harmony.menalto.com>

	* All references to specific images now use the image ID (eg
	  "photo-aaa", "photo-aac") instead of the image index (eg "1",
	  "3").  This means that URLs to specific images will continue to
	  be valid even if they are moved around the album.  That's
	  essential if you want to give a URL for an image to a friend.

	* Broke main album page into separate pages and used the navigator
	  to swap between them.  This will lighten the server load since
	  every time the end user goes to the main gallery page they won't
	  be downloading every highlight image.  Not to mention the fact
	  that in large galleries you can have a ton of HTML just to
	  display all the album names, etc.

2000-12-26  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@harmony.menalto.com>

	* Rotating photos now also rotates the resized version (instead of
	  throwing it out).
	
2000-11-23  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@harmony.menalto.com>

	* Removed an extra backslash from htaccess.template that was
	  causing the mod_rewrite rules generated in .htaccess to be
	  broken.  This caused us not to be able to view album photos.

2000-09-28  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@harmony.menalto.com>

	* Removed final dependencies on GD and JPEG, so likewise removed
	  those checks from the config wizard

	* Setup code: Made the code that detects the webserver uid more
	  robust so that it'll work in the absence of posix (it falls back
	  on 'whoami')

	* Setup code: Removed extra commas at the end of array
	  initializers as they caused parse problems on earlier versions
	  of PHP 4  

2000-09-19  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Added error checking code to allow us to catch photos that we
	  won't be able to work with and flag them early.  This helps us
	  prevent having extra crufty file lying around the album from
	  failed photo insertions (which in turn leads to problems when we
	  want to delete the album)
	  
	* Abstracted my ad-hoc flush code into a function and put it in
	  util.php

	* Broke classes.php up into individual class files.  I should have
	  done this ages ago...the repetition of method names across
	  classes makes it hard to find the right method if they're all in
	  the same file.

2000-09-17  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Added versioning support

	* Added feedback to the user when resizing all thumbnails or all
	  photos. 

	* Lots of small changes regarding thumbnails not worth mentioning
	  here. 

	* Fixed a bug where resizing to original size was not working at all.

	* Removed gif_support feature because now NetPBM is mandatory.

	* resize now uses the netpbm library to do resize instead of
	  GD. This rUleZ. [CHRIS]

	* Made the border size a choice so that off could be an
	  option. Also made the resize a choice, for the same reason [CHRIS]

	* When loading the old values, it was looking at
	  app->defaults[xxx] instead of app->default[xxx], so the defaults
	  was always getting reset to the original settings.  [CHRIS]

	* Fixed several bugs stemmming from the fact that we were not
	  always correctly treating all thumbnails as JPGs.  This would
	  mean that we'd sometimes leave cruft files lying around which
	  would prevent deleting albums.

2000-07-05  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Added new setup process using the 'setup' directory.  This
	set of pages, although not yet very robust, will walk you through
	the process of configuring Gallery for your local site.

2000-07-04  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com>

	* Updated README to reflect v1.0 feature list
