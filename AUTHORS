Many people have dedicated their time to making Gallery what it is
today.  Here is a list of folks in alphabetical order who have
contributed to the project in the form of new code, patches, bug fixes,
or support.  Corrections, additions, deletions welcome.

[N.B.  In this first release of this file I am *sure* I'm
       leaving some folks out.  Don't be shy, tell me!  -BM]
